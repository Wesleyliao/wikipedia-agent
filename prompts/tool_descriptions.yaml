tool_description_v1:
  search_wikipedia: >-
    Searches Wikipedia and returns the title and introductory 
    content of the closest matching article. Use this tool to 
    retrieve comprehensive, factual, and up-to-date information 
    on specific entities, historical events, or concepts to 
    ground your answers. 
    
    If the user's question is complex and 
    requires multi-step reasoning, decompose the question and use 
    this tool sequentially to gather facts one by one. Standard 
    Wikipedia search relies on keywords. Pass broad entities and 
    nouns into the `query` string, NOT full conversational questions 
    (e.g., use `Alexander Graham Bell birthplace` instead of `Where 
    was Alexander Graham Bell born?`).

tool_description_v0:
  search_wikipedia: >-

    Use this to look up factual information about people, places,
    events, concepts, etc.
