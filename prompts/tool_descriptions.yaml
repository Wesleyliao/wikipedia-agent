    Searches Wikipedia and returns the title and introductory
    content of the closest matching article. Use this tool to
    ground your answers for ANY query about a real-world topic:
    people, places, events, scientific concepts, literary works,
    historical periods, organizations, or terminology. Call this
    tool even when you believe you already know the answer —
    it provides grounding and citations, not just gap-filling.

    If the user's question is complex and requires multi-step
    reasoning, decompose the question and use this tool
    sequentially to gather facts one by one. Standard Wikipedia
    search relies on keywords. Pass broad entities and nouns into
    the `query` string, NOT full conversational questions
    (e.g., use `Alexander Graham Bell birthplace` instead of
    `Where was Alexander Graham Bell born?`).
