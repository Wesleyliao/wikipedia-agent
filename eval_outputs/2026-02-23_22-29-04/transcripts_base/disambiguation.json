In reality, these were the rings around the planet, which his telescope was not powerful enough to distinguish.\nThe painting represents the Greek myth of the titan Cronus devouring his children. In the original myth, Cronus swallowed his children whole, and later spit them out, also whole. The painting, however, shows Cronus taking a bite out of one of his children."

More than 800 marathons are held worldwide each year, with the vast majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.\nA creation of the French philologist Michel Br\u00e9al inspired by a story from Ancient Greece, the marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896 in Athens. The distance did not become standardized until 1921. The distance is also included in the World Athletics Championships, which began in 1983.

The distance of the race is that of a marathon; 26.219 miles or 42.195 kilometres.

The current \"Women Only\" record of 2:15:50 was set by Tigst Assefa on April 27, 2025, at the London Marathon in the elite women's race.\n\n"
