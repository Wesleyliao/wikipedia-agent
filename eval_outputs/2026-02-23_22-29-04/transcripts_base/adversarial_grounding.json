At 7,088 km  long, it is the longest river in the world, although the volume of water it carries is much smaller than other major rivers such as the Amazon or Congo.   The Nile has played a central role in the environmental, economic, and cultural history of Africa for millennia.  The river's drainage basin covers portions of eleven countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is longer and is considered to be the headwaters, although the Blue Nile contributes over two thirds of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan; and the Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The ...\n\n---\n\n## Nile Delta\nThe Nile Delta (Arabic: \u062f\u0644\u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644, Delta an-N\u012bl or simply \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u062a\u0627, ad-Delta) is the delta formed in Lower Egypt where the Nile River spreads out and drains into the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the world's largest deltas. From Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east; it covers 240 km (150 mi) of the Mediterranean coastline and is a rich agricultural region. From north to south the delta is approximately 160 km (100 mi) in length. The Delta begins from Cairo.\n\n---\n\n## White Nile\nThe White Nile (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 an-n\u012bl al-'abya\u1e0d) is a river in North and East Africa, the minor of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the larger being the Blue Nile. The name \"White\" comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.\nIn the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, \"White Nile\" refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the \"Albert Nile\" to the South Sudan border, and then the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Bahr-al-Jabal\" down to Lake No. \"White Nile\" may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being 3,700 km (2,300 mi) from the Blue Nile."

Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor.

The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550\u2013574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115\u20131234), and particularly the Ming (1369\u20131644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications c...\n\n---\n\n## History of the Great Wall of China\nThe history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771\u2013476 BC) and Warring States periods (475\u2013221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550\u2013574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115\u20131234), and particularly the Ming (1369\u20131644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618..."

Polish-born Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, her French husband Pierre Curie, their daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, and son-in-law, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie, are its most prominent members. Five members of the family in total were awarded a Nobel Prize, with Marie winning twice.\nMarie and Pierre shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and Marie was awarded a second one in chemistry in 1911, making her the first person in history to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific disciplines. To date, only Linus Pauling has followed her in winning prizes in multiple categories, in chemistry and peace. Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr., the spouse of Ir\u00e8ne's younger sister, \u00c8ve Curie, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965. \nThe chemical element curium (number 96) is named after Marie and Pierre.\nWhile Pierre Curie died at age 46 from an accident, M...\n\n---\n\n## Marie Curie\nMaria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska Curie (Polish: [\u02c8marja sal\u0254\u02c8m\u025ba skw\u0254\u02c8d\u0254fska k\u02b2i\u02c8ri] ; n\u00e9e Sk\u0142odowska; 7 November 1867 \u2013 4 July 1934), better known as Marie Curie ( KURE-ee; French: [ma\u0281i ky\u0281i] ), was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie \"for their joint researches on the  radioactivity phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel\". She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"[for] the discovery of the  elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\". \nShe was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. Marie and Pierre were the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Pa...\n\n---\n\n## Pierre Curie\nPierre Curie (15 May 1859 \u2013 19 April 1906) was a French physicist and chemist, and a pioneer in crystallography and magnetism. He shared one half of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie, for their work on radioactivity. With their win, the Curies became the first married couple to win a Nobel Prize, launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes."
