The ride featured a turbulent journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics. Originally named Countdown to Extinction when the park opened on April 22, 1998, the ride was re-named to Dinosaur in 2000 to promote Disney Animation's feature film of the same name. In the attraction, the two prominently featured dinosaurs were the Iguanodon and Carnotaurus, which were also featured in the film. Scenes from the movie also appeared in the pre-show.\nIn August 2024, it was announced at the D23 fan event that the area that the ride is located in, DinoLand U.S.A., will be replaced with a new land called Tropical Americas, which is expected to open in Fall 2027, with an Indiana Jones attraction replacing Dinosaur.

It represents one of five major extinction events during the Phanerozoic, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. \nIn the seas, about 23\u201334% of marine genera disappeared; corals, bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, and radiolarians suffered severe losses of diversity and conodonts were completely wiped out, while marine vertebrates, gastropods, and benthic foraminifera were relatively unaffected. On land, all archosauromorph reptiles other than crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs became extinct. Crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals were left largely untouched, allowing them to become the dominant land animals for the next 135 million years.

The event caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs and most other tetrapods weighing more than 25 kg (55 lb), with the exception of some ectothermic species such as sea turtles and crocodilians. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period, and with it the Mesozoic era, while heralding the beginning of the current geological era, the Cenozoic Era. In the geologic record, the K\u2013Pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K\u2013Pg boundary or K\u2013T boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows unusually high levels of the metal iridium, which is more common in asteroids than in the Earth's crust.\nIt is now generally thought that the K\u2013Pg extinction resulted from t...\n\n---\n\n## Dinosaur (Disney's Animal Kingdom)\nDinosaur (stylized in all caps as \u201cDINOSAUR\u201d) was a dark ride EMV attraction at Disney's Animal Kingdom at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. The ride featured a turbulent journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics. Originally named Countdown to Extinction when the park opened on April 22, 1998, the ride was re-named to Dinosaur in 2000 to promote Disney Animation's feature film of the same name. In the attraction, the two prominently featured dinosaurs were the Iguanodon and Carnotaurus, which were also featured in the film. Scenes from the movie also appeared in the pre-show.\nIn August 2024, it was announced at the D23 fan event that the area that the ride is located in, DinoLand U.S.A., will be replaced with a new land called Tropical Americas, which is expected to open in Fall 2027, with an Indiana Jones attraction replacing Dinosaur. Dinosaur closed on February 2, 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction\nThe Triassic\u2013Jurassic (Tr-J) extinction event, often called the Triassic\u2013Jurassic mass extinction (TJME) or end-Triassic extinction, marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 201.4 million years ago. It represents one of five major extinction events during the Phanerozoic, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. \nIn the seas, about 23\u201334% of marine genera disappeared; corals, bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, and radiolarians suffered severe losses of diversity and conodonts were completely wiped out, while marine vertebrates, gastropods, and benthic foraminifera were relatively unaffected. On land, all archosauromorph reptiles other than crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs became extinct. Crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals were left largely untouched, allowing them to become the dominant land animals for the next 135 million years. Plants were likewise significantly affected by the crisis, with floral communities undergoing radi..."

He was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration, a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life. He is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of nearly all organisms, including humans, other than anaerobic microorganisms, namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. The former, often eponymously known as the \"Krebs cycle\", is the sequence of metabolic reactions that allows cells of oxygen-respiring organisms to obtain far more ATP from the food they consume than anaerobic processes such as glycolysis can supply; and its discovery earned Krebs a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953. With Hans Kornberg, he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle, a slight...\n\n---\n\n## Reverse Krebs cycle\nThe reverse Krebs cycle (also known as the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, the reverse TCA cycle, or the reverse citric acid cycle, or the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, or the reductive TCA cycle) \nis a sequence of chemical reactions that are used by some bacteria and archaea to produce carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by the use of energy-rich reducing agents as electron donors.\nThe reaction is the citric acid cycle run in reverse. Where the Krebs cycle takes carbohydrates and oxidizes them to CO2 and water, the reverse cycle takes CO2 and H2O to make carbon compounds.\nThis process is used by some bacteria (such as Aquificota) to synthesize carbon compounds, sometimes using hydrogen, sulfide, or thiosulfate as electron donors. This process can be seen as an alternative to the fixation of inorganic carbon in the  Calvin cycle which occurs in a wide variety of microbes and higher organisms."

In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent NADH, which are used in other reactions. Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest metabolic components. Even though it is branded as a \"cycle\", it is not necessary for metabolites to follow a specific route; at least three alternative pathways of the citric acid cycle are recognized.\nIts name is derived from the citric acid (a tricarboxylic acid, often called citrate, as the ionized form predominates at ...\n\n---\n\n## Hans Krebs (biochemist)\nSir Hans Adolf Krebs, FRS (, German: [hans \u02c8\u0294a\u02d0d\u0254lf \u02c8k\u0281e\u02d0ps] ; 25 August 1900 \u2013 22 November 1981) was a German-British biologist, physician and biochemist. He was a pioneer scientist in the study of cellular respiration, a biochemical process in living cells that extracts energy from food and oxygen and makes it available to drive the processes of life. He is best known for his discoveries of two important sequences of chemical reactions that take place in the cells of nearly all organisms, including humans, other than anaerobic microorganisms, namely the citric acid cycle and the urea cycle. The former, often eponymously known as the \"Krebs cycle\", is the sequence of metabolic reactions that allows cells of oxygen-respiring organisms to obtain far more ATP from the food they consume than anaerobic processes such as glycolysis can supply; and its discovery earned Krebs a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953. With Hans Kornberg, he also discovered the glyoxylate cycle, a slight...\n\n---\n\n## Reverse Krebs cycle\nThe reverse Krebs cycle (also known as the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, the reverse TCA cycle, or the reverse citric acid cycle, or the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, or the reductive TCA cycle) \nis a sequence of chemical reactions that are used by some bacteria and archaea to produce carbon compounds from carbon dioxide and water by the use of energy-rich reducing agents as electron donors.\nThe reaction is the citric acid cycle run in reverse. Where the Krebs cycle takes carbohydrates and oxidizes them to CO2 and water, the reverse cycle takes CO2 and H2O to make carbon compounds.\nThis process is used by some bacteria (such as Aquificota) to synthesize carbon compounds, sometimes using hydrogen, sulfide, or thiosulfate as electron donors. This process can be seen as an alternative to the fixation of inorganic carbon in the  Calvin cycle which occurs in a wide variety of microbes and higher organisms."
