Construction of the Berlin Wall was commenced by the government of the GDR on 13 August 1961. It included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses. The primary intention for the Wall's construction was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.\nThe Soviet Bloc propaganda portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from \"fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people\" from building a communist state in the GDR.

The fall of the inner German border took place shortly afterward. An end to the Cold War was declared at the Malta Summit in early December, and German reunification took place in October the following year.\n\n---\n\n## List of deaths at the Berlin Wall\nThere were numerous deaths at the Berlin Wall, which stood as a barrier between West Berlin and East Berlin from 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989. Before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin. From there they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the Wall prevented almost all such emigration.\nThe state-funded Centre for Contemporary History (ZZF) in Potsdam has confirmed that \"at least 140 people were killed at the Berlin Wall or died under circumstances directly connected with the GDR border regime\", including people attempting to escape, border guards, and innocent parties; however, researchers at the Checkpoint Charlie Museum have estimated the death toll to be significantly higher.\n\nEscape attempts claimed the lives of many, from a child as young as one to an 80-year-old wom..."

At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value.

At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures.

It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about 9 times that of Earth. It has an eighth of the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third of its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size.

Titan is far colder than Earth, but of all the places in the Solar System, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface. Its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are small and large bodies of both liquid methane and ethane, and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell. Some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide prebiotic chemistry for living cells different from those on Earth.\nIn June 2010, scientists analyzing data from the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.

Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter).

Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit). They include the seven rounded satellites, and four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with some of the large moons. Fou...\n\n---\n\n## Saturn\nSaturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about 9 times that of Earth. It has an eighth of the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third of its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about..."

Titan is the only natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System with an atmosphere that is denser than the atmosphere of Earth and is one of two moons with an atmosphere significant enough to drive weather (the other being the atmosphere of Triton). Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, propane, PAHs and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, acetonitrile, argon and helium. The isotopic study of nitrogen isotopes ratio also suggests acetonitrile may be present in quantities exceeding hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene. The surface pressure is about 50% higher than on Earth at 1.5 bars (147 kPa). This is higher than the pressure at the triple point of m...\n\n---\n\n## Life on Titan\nWhether there is life on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is currently an open question and a topic of scientific assessment and research. Titan is far colder than Earth, but of all the places in the Solar System, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface. Its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are small and large bodies of both liquid methane and ethane, and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell. Some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide prebiotic chemistry for living cells different from those on Earth.\nIn June 2010, scientists analyzing data from the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes. The Cassini\u2013Huygens miss...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere\u2014denser than Earth's\u2014and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km abo..."

It corresponds roughly to the territory of modern Iraq. Just beyond it lies southwestern Iran, where the region transitions into the Persian plateau, marking the shift from the Arab world to Iran.\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history, including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture\". It is recognised as the cradle of some of the world's earliest civilizations.\nThe Sumerians and Akkadians, each originating from different areas, dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of recorded history (c.\u20093100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. The rise of empires, beginning with Sargon o...\n\n---\n\n## Tigris\nThe Tigris ( TY-griss; see below) is the eastern of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of the Armenian Highlands through the Syrian and Arabian Deserts, before merging with the Euphrates and reaching to the Persian Gulf.\nThe Tigris passes through historical cities such as Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra and Baghdad. It is also home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. In ancient times the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants such as the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser.\nToday the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future.\n\n---\n\n## Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system\nThe Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system is a large river system in West Asia that flows into the Persian Gulf. Its primary rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates, along with smaller tributaries.\nFrom their sources and upper courses in the eastern Turkey, being Lake Hazar for the Tigris and Karasu along with the Murat River for the Euphrates, the two rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq. Other tributaries join the Tigris from sources in the Zagros Mountains to the east. The rivers flow in a south-easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf. The rivers and their tributaries drain an area of 879,790 square kilometres (339,690 sq mi), including almost the entire area of Iraq as well as portions of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Kuwait.\nThe region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civ..."

Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known.

The title of \"world's tallest building\" has been held  by various buildings in modern times, including Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England, and the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, both in New York City.\nBefore the modern skyscraper era emerged, between c. 1311 and 1884 the tallest buildings and structures were mostly Christian churches and cathedrals. Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world until Lincoln Cathedral of 1311, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable.

Basilicas are either major basilicas, of which there are four, all in the Diocese of Rome, or minor basilicas, of which there were 1,924 worldwide as of 2023.\nNumerous basilicas are notable shrines, often receiving pilgrimages, especially among the many that were built above a confessio or the burial place of a martyr; although this term now usually designates a space before the high altar that is sunk lower than the main floor level (as in the case in St. Peter's and St. John Lateran in Rome) and that offer more immediate access to the burial places below.

Nowadays, it is considered a movement based on the cultural revindication of a Catalan identity. Its main form of expression was Modernista architecture, but it also encompassed many other arts, such as painting and  sculpture, and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture.

To its west it is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the Strait of Gibraltar that separates the Iberian Peninsula in Europe from Morocco in Africa by only 14 km (9 mi); additionally, it is connected to  the Black Sea through the Bosporus strait that intersects Turkey in the northeast and the Red Sea via the Suez Canal in the southeast.\nThe Mediterranean Sea covers an area of about 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi), representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface; it includes fifteen marginal seas, including the Aegean, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, and Marmara.

It is spoken as a first language by the Amhara people, and also serves as a lingua franca for all other metropolitan populations in Ethiopia.\nThe language serves as the official working language of the Ethiopian federal government, and is also the official or working language of several of Ethiopia's federal regions. In 2020 in Ethiopia, it had over 33.7 million mother-tongue speakers of which 31 million are ethnically Amhara, and more than 25.1 million second language speakers in 2019, making the total number of speakers over 58.8 million. Amharic is the largest, most widely spoken language in Ethiopia, and the most spoken mother-tongue in Ethiopia.

They form the western branch of the South Semitic languages, itself a sub-branch of Semitic, part of the Afroasiatic language family.\nWith 57,500,000 total speakers as of 2019, including around 25,100,000 second language speakers, Amharic is the most widely spoken of the group, the most widely spoken language of Ethiopia and second-most widely spoken Semitic language in the world after Arabic. Tigrinya has 7 million speakers and is the most widely spoken language in Eritrea. Tigre is the second-most spoken language in Eritrea, and has also a small population of speakers in Sudan. The Ge\u02bdez language has a literary history in its own script starting in the 1st century. Ge\u02bdez is no longer spoken, but remains the liturgical language of the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, as well as their respective Eastern Catholic counterparts.\n\n---\n\n## Languages of Ethiopia\nThe languages of Ethiopia include the official languages of Ethiopia, its national and regional languages, and a large number of minority languages, as well as foreign languages."

The language originates from what is now known as Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nAs of today, Ge\u02bdez is used as the main liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community.\nHawulti Obelisk is an ancient pre-Aksumite obelisk located in Matara, Eritrea. The monument dates to the early Aksumite period and bears an example of the ancient Ge\u02bdez script.\nIn one study, Tigre was found to have a 71% lexical similarity to Ge\u02bdez, while Tigrinya had a 68% lexical similarity to Ge\u02bdez, followed by Amharic at 62%.

It originated as an abjad (consonantal alphabet) and was first used to write the Ge\u02bdez language, now the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, and Haymanot Judaism of the Beta Israel Jewish community in Ethiopia. In the languages Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is often called fid\u00e4l (\u134a\u12f0\u120d), meaning \"script\" or \"letter\". Under the Unicode Standard and ISO 15924, it is defined as Ge'ez text.\n\nThe Ge\u02bdez script has been adapted to write other languages, mostly Ethiopian and Eritrean Semitic, particularly Amharic in Ethiopia, and Tigrinya in both Eritrea and Ethiopia.

Most of what is known about Denisovans comes from DNA evidence. While many recent fossils have been found and tentatively identified as Denisovan, the first Denisovans discovered were known from few physical remains. Consequently, no formal species name has been established. However, an analysis of the mitochondrial DNA and endogenous proteins from the Harbin cranium, which had been given the name Homo longi, showed with great certainty that this species represents a Denisovan.\nIn a study published in September 2025, remains from six additional sites in China including the 1 million year old Yunxian man were proposed to be included in the species Homo longi along with the genetically confirmed Denisovans.\nThe first identification of a Denisovan individual occurred in 2010, based o...\n\n---\n\n## Osteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass (osteopenia), micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to more porous bone, and consequent increase in fracture risk. Bones undergo continuous remodeling: osteoclasts resorb old bone, and osteoblasts synthesize new bone. With advancing age, the rate of resorption exceeds that of bone formation, causing bones to lose density and become more susceptible to fractures.\nIt is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, the wrist, and the hip.\nUntil a broken bone occurs, there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, some people may have chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities.\nOsteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bo..."

Cro-Magnons produced Upper Palaeolithic cultures, the first major one being the Aurignacian, which was succeeded by the Gravettian by 30,000 years ago. The Gravettian split into the Epi-Gravettian in the east and Solutrean in...\n\n---\n\n## Denisovan\nThe Denisovans or Denisova hominins ( d\u0259-NEE-s\u0259-v\u0259) are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic human that ranged across Asia during the Middle to Late Pleistocene, approximately 200,000\u201332,000 years ago. Most of what is known about Denisovans comes from DNA evidence. While many recent fossils have been found and tentatively identified as Denisovan, the first Denisovans discovered were known from few physical remains. Consequently, no formal species name has been established. However, an analysis of the mitochondrial DNA and endogenous proteins from the Harbin cranium, which had been given the name Homo longi, showed with great certainty that this species represents a Denisovan.\nIn a study published in September 2025, remains from six additional sites in China including the 1 million year old Yunxian man were proposed to be included in the species Homo longi along with the genetically confirmed Denisovans.\nThe first identification of a Denisovan individual occurred in 2010, based o...\n\n---\n\n## Osteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass (osteopenia), micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to more porous bone, and consequent increase in fracture risk. Bones undergo continuous remodeling: osteoclasts resorb old bone, and osteoblasts synthesize new bone. With advancing age, the rate of resorption exceeds that of bone formation, causing bones to lose density and become more susceptible to fractures.\nIt is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, the wrist, and the hip.\nUntil a broken bone occurs, there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, some people may have chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities.\nOsteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bo..."

In many four-legged animals, the femur is the upper bone of the hindleg.\nThe top of the femur fits into a socket in the pelvis called the hip joint, and the bottom of the femur connects to the shinbone (tibia) and kneecap (patella) to form the knee. In humans the femur is the  largest and thickest bone in the body.\n\n---\n\n## Giant human skeletons\nGiant skeletons reported in the United States until the early 20th century were a combination of hoaxes, scams, fabrications, and the misidentifications of extinct megafauna. Many were reported to have been found in Native American burial mounds. Examples from 7 ft (2.1 m) to 20 ft (6.1 m) tall were reported in many parts of the United States.\nThe claims of \"giant skeletons\" were debunked in 1934 by Ale\u0161 Hrdli\u010dka, curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Institution opposed the popular myth that an \"ancient white race\" were the Mound Builders. The role of the Smithsonian Institution in debunking such claims led to a conspiracy theory that Smithsonian archeologists were destroying giants' bones in order to cover up the existence of giants.\nHrdli\u010dka blamed the reports of giant skeletons on the \"will to believe\" coupled with \"amateur anthropologists\" who were unfamiliar with human anatomy. In 2014 an internet story began circulating which claimed that the Sm...\n\n---\n\n## Human leg\nThe human leg is the lower limb of the human body, including the thigh, knee, lower leg, ankle, foot, or sometimes even the hip or buttock region. There are thirty bones in each leg. The major bones are the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shinbone), and adjacent fibula.\nThe part of the leg between the hip and the knee is called the thigh. The part between the knee and the ankle is called the lower leg, shank, crus, or in anatomy simply the leg. The lower leg includes the shin in the front and the calf at the back.\nLegs are used for standing, many forms of human movement, recreation such as dancing, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. Evolution has led to the human leg's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait. While the capacity to walk upright is not unique to humans, other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy. In humans, female legs generally have greater hip anteversion and tibiofem..."

It was announced by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 October 2024 and was awarded on 10 December 2024. \nShe is the first South Korean and first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, making her the 18th woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature and the tenth Asian laureate in that Nobel Prize category.\n\n---\n\n## 2025 Nobel Peace Prize\nThe 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, an international peace prize established according to the will of Alfred Nobel, was announced on 10 October 2025 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway. It was awarded to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado of Venezuela. The prize was presented at the ceremony on 10 December 2025 in Oslo, given to her daughter on her behalf. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".\nAt the time of the prize's announcement, Machado was in hiding inside Venezuela, fearing repression from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. She secretly escaped the country to reach Oslo with the help of international allies, but vowed to return to Venezuela to continue opposing the Maduro regime. Machado said she dedicated her award to Donald Trump and after the 2026 United States intervention in Venezuela she gave him her Nobel medal as a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom, according to...\n\n---\n\n## List of Ig Nobel Prize winners\nA parody of the Nobel Prizes, the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\". Commenting on the 2006 awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsor of the awards, said that \"[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology\". All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release."

In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe. Like Jupiter's spot, the Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms. However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot. Little is known about the origins, movement, and disappearance of the dark spots observed on the planet since 1989.\n\n---\n\n## Great Red Spot\nThe Great Red Spot is a persistent, high-pressure region in the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter, producing the largest anticyclonic storm in the Solar System. It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). It was first observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began. A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; if this is the same storm, it has existed for at least 361 years, but a study from 2024 suggests this is not the case."
