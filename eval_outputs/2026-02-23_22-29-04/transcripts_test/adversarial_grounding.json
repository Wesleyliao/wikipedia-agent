It is one of the world's largest deltas. From Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east; it covers 240 km (150 mi) of the Mediterranean coastline and is a rich agricultural region. From north to south the delta is approximately 160 km (100 mi) in length. The Delta begins from Cairo.\n\n---\n\n## White Nile\nThe White Nile (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 an-n\u012bl al-'abya\u1e0d) is a river in North and East Africa, the minor of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the larger being the Blue Nile. The name \"White\" comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.\nIn the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, \"White Nile\" refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the \"Albert Nile\" to the South Sudan border, and then the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Bahr-al-Jabal\" down to Lake No. \"White Nile\" may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being 3,700 km (2,300 mi) from the Blue Nile."

Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at 02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material before re-entering the Lunar Module.

The first human-made object to touch the Moon was Luna 2 in 1959.\nIn 1969, Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon. There were six crewed landings between 1969 and 1972 and numerous uncrewed landings. All crewed missions to the Moon were conducted by the Apollo program, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. After Luna 24 in 1976, there were no soft landings\u2014 landings without significant damage\u2014on the Moon until Chang'e 3 in 2013. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until January 2019, when Chang'e 4 made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Soviet space program\nThe Soviet space program (Russian: \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0430 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420, romanized: Kosmicheskaya programma SSSR) was the state space program of the Soviet Union, active from 1951 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Contrary to its competitors (NASA in the United States, the European Space Agency in Western Europe, and the Ministry of Aerospace Industry in China), which had their programs run under single coordinating agencies, the Soviet space program was divided between several internally competing design bureaus led by Korolev, Kerimov, Keldysh, Yangel, Glushko, Chelomey, Makeyev, Chertok and Reshetnev. Several of these bureaus were subordinated to the Ministry of General Machine-Building. The Soviet space program served as an important marker of claims by the Soviet Union to its superpower status.\nSoviet investigations into rocketry began with the formation of the Gas Dynamics Laboratory in 1921, and these endeavors expanded during the 1930s and 1940s.

Due to the planet's extremely hostile surface environment, proposals for settling Venus focus on habitats floating in the upper-middle atmosphere or on settlement of the surface contingent on first terraforming the planet.\nThe colonization of Venus has been a subject of many works of science fiction since before the dawn of spaceflight, and is still discussed from both a fictional and a scientific standpoint.\n\n---\n\n## List of geological features on Venus\nVenus, the second planet from the Sun, is classified as a terrestrial planet. It is sometimes called Earth's \"sister planet\" due to their similar size, gravity, and bulk composition (Venus is both the closest planet to Earth and the planet closest in size to Earth). The surface of Venus is covered by a dense atmosphere and presents clear evidence of former violent volcanic activity. It has shield and composite volcanoes similar to those found on Earth.\n\n---\n\n## Venus\nVenus is the second planet from the Sun. It is often called Earth's \"twin\" or \"sister\" among the planets of the Solar System for its orbit being the closest to Earth's, both being terrestrial planets, and having the most similar and nearly equal size, mass, and surface gravity. Venus, though, is significantly different, especially as it has no liquid water, and its atmosphere is far thicker and denser than that of any other rocky body in the Solar System. The atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide and has a thick cloud layer of sulfuric acid that spans the whole planet. At the mean surface level, the atmosphere reaches a temperature of 737 K (464 \u00b0C; 867 \u00b0F) and a pressure 92 times greater than Earth's at sea level, turning the lowest layer of the atmosphere into a supercritical fluid. From Earth, Venus is visible as a star-like point of light, appearing brighter than any other natural point of light in the sky, and as an inferior planet it is always relatively close to the Su..."
