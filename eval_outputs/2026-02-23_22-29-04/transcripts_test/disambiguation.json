They observe the shadows projected onto the outer wall by objects carried behind the inner wall by people who are invisible to the chained \u201cprisoners\u201d and who walk along the inner wall with a fire behind them, creating the shadows on the inner wall in front of the prisoners.

From the Middle Ages onwards, Islamic and Jewish authors expanded on the theory, adapting it to suit their own conceptions of the perfect ruler.\nSeveral historical figures, including Marcus Aurelius and Ashoka the Great, have been described by ancient and modern writers as embodying the philosopher king ideal.\n\n---\n\n## Plato\nPlato ( PLAY-toe; Greek: \u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd, Pl\u00e1t\u014dn; born c.\u2009428\u2013423 BC, died 348/347 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher of Classical Athens who is most commonly considered the foundational thinker of the Western philosophical tradition.
