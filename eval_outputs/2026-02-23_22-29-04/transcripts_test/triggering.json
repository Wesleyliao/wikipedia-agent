After his death in 1896, the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel established that an annual prize be awarded for service to humanity in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. Similarly, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, first awarded in 1969 year, is awarded along with the Nobel Prizes.\nNobel sought to reward \"those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\". One prize, he stated, should be given \"to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics\". Awards committees have historically rewarded discoveries over inventions: up to 2004 year, 77 percent of Nobel Prizes in Physics have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23 percent to inventions...."

Sharing many characteristics with fellow COMECON member states \u2014 the East German economy stood in stark contrast to the market and mixed economies of Western Europe and West Germany. The state established production targets, set prices, and also allocated resources, codifying these decisions in comprehensive plans. The means of production were almost entirely state-owned. The GDR had an above-average standard of living compared to other Eastern Bloc countries or the Soviet Union, and enjoyed favorable duty and tariff terms with the West German market; in 1989, it was estimated that 50 to 60% of its trade was with Western countries. However by the mid-1980s its economy had reached a state of stagnation, contributing to the process of German reunification.\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Germany\nGermany has a highly developed social market economy. It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but has ranked among the world's top four since 1960. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Germany accounted for 23.7% of the Eurozone economy in 2025, with which it has achieved a high degree of economic integration. With a population of around 83,000,000 people, Germany represents the largest consumer market in the European Union. It is a founding member of both the European Union and the Eurozone.\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally, with $1.66 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus of $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Nazi Germany\nLike many other nations at the time, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression, with unemployment soaring after the Wall Street crash of 1929. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they ..."

Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita...\n\n---\n\n## List of countries by largest historical GDP\nThis list of countries by largest historical GDP shows how the membership and rankings of the world's ten largest economies as measured by their gross domestic product has changed. While the United States has consistently had the world's largest economy for some time, in the last fifty years the world has seen both rises and falls in relative terms of the economies of other countries."

Sharing many characteristics with fellow COMECON member states \u2014 the East German economy stood in stark contrast to the market and mixed economies of Western Europe and West Germany. The state established production targets, set prices, and also allocated resources, codifying these decisions in comprehensive plans. The means of production were almost entirely state-owned. The GDR had an above-average standard of living compared to other Eastern Bloc countries or the Soviet Union, and enjoyed favorable duty and tariff terms with the West German market; in 1989, it was estimated that 50 to 60% of its trade was with Western countries. However by the mid-1980s its economy had reached a state of stagnation, contributing to the process of German reunification.\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Germany\nGermany has a highly developed social market economy. It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but has ranked among the world's top four since 1960. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Germany accounted for 23.7% of the Eurozone economy in 2025, with which it has achieved a high degree of economic integration. With a population of around 83,000,000 people, Germany represents the largest consumer market in the European Union. It is a founding member of both the European Union and the Eurozone.\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally, with $1.66 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus of $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Nazi Germany\nLike many other nations at the time, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression, with unemployment soaring after the Wall Street crash of 1929. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they ..."
