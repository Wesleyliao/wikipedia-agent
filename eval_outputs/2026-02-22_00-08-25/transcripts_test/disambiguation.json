Java applications are compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture, giving it its platform-independent nature.\n\n**Evolution**: Since JDK 1.0, Java has undergone numerous changes. From JDK 1.4 onward, the language's evolution has been governed by the **Java Community Process (JCP)**, which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes. The Java Class Library has grown significantly from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5, with new APIs like Swing being added over time.\n\n**Release Schedule**: In September 2017, Mark Reinhold (chief architect of the Java Platform) proposed changing the release schedule from a two-year cycle to **one feature release every six months**, which remains the current release schedule.\n\n**Popularity**: Java gained popularity shortly after its release and has remained one of the most popular programming languages, ranking as the third most popular programming language according to GitHub in 2022.\n\n**Sources**: Wikipedia articles on Java (programming language), Java version history, and Outline of the Java programming language",

It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of Pacific Ocean) to the north. With a population of 156.9 million people (including Madura) in mid 2024, projected to have risen to 158 million by mid-2025, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population while constituting only 7% of its land area. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobud...\n\n---\n\n## Java version history\nThe Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017, Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release train to \"one feature release every six months\" rather than the then-current two-year schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the current release schedule.\nIn addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5.

        "output": "## History of programming languages\nThe history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalk\u00fcl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado B\u00f6hm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Java (programming language)\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of Pacific Ocean) to the north. With a population of 156.9 million people (including Madura) in mid 2024, projected to have risen to 158 million by mid-2025, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population while constituting only 7% of its land area. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobud...\n\n---\n\n## Java version history\nThe Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017, Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release train to \"one feature release every six months\" rather than the then-current two-year schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the current release schedule.\nIn addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and..."

            "content": "## History of programming languages\nThe history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalk\u00fcl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado B\u00f6hm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Java (programming language)\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.

DNA floats freely in the nucleoid region.\n2. **Eukaryotic cells**: Complex cells with a nucleus that contains DNA, plus membrane-bound organelles. Found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists.\n\n**Common Functions**:\n- Energy production and metabolism\n- Growth and reproduction\n- Response to environmental stimuli\n- Waste removal\n- Maintaining internal conditions\n\n**Size**: Most cells are microscopic and can only be seen with a microscope. However, some cells (like egg cells) are visible to the naked eye.\n\n**Cell Theory**: The foundational principle that all living organisms are made of one or more cells, and all cells come from pre-existing cells.\n\nIn essence, whether you're looking at a bacterium, a plant leaf, or a human tissue, cells are the building blocks that make up all life on Earth.",

Here are the key points:\\n\\n**Definition**: A cell is the smallest unit of an organism that can function independently and perform all the necessary functions of life.\\n\\n**Key Characteristics**:\\n- **Membrane-bound**: All cells are enclosed by a cell membrane (plasma membrane) that controls what enters and exits the cell.\\n- **Contains genetic material**: Cells contain DNA, which carries instructions for life processes and reproduction.\\n- **Cytoplasm**: The gel-like substance inside the cell where organelles and other structures are suspended.\\n\\n**Two Main Types**:\\n1. **Prokaryotic cells**: Simple cells without a nucleus (bacteria and archaea). DNA floats freely in the nucleoid region.\\n2. **Eukaryotic cells**: Complex cells with a nucleus that contains DNA, plus membrane-bound organelles. Found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists.\\n\\n**Common Functions**:\\n- Energy production and metabolism\\n- Growth and reproduction\\n- Response to environmental stimuli\\n- Waste removal\\n- Maintaining internal conditions\\n\\n**Size**: Most cells are microscopic and can only be seen with a microscope. However, some cells (like egg cells) are visible to the naked eye.\\n\\n**Cell Theory**: The foundational principle that all living organisms are made of one or more cells, and all cells come from pre-existing cells.\\n\\nIn essence, whether you're looking at a bacterium, a plant leaf, or a human tissue, cells are the building blocks that make up all life on Earth.\", type='text')"
