Construction of the Berlin Wall was commenced by the government of the GDR on 13 August 1961. It included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, beds of nails and other defenses. The primary intention for the Wall's construction was to prevent East German citizens from fleeing to the West.\nThe Soviet Bloc propaganda portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from \"fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people\" from building a communist state in the GDR. The authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (Antifaschistischer Schutzwall, pronounced [antifa\u02cc\u0283\u026ast\u026a\u0283\u0250 \u02c8\u0283\u028atsval] ).

At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures.

            "content": "## Melting point\nThe melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.  Some common variants are:\n\n(Ta \u2013 2.5% W): also called tantaloy 63 metal. The percentage of tungsten is about 2\u20133% and includes 0.5% of niobium.  This alloy has a good resistance to corrosion and performs well at high temperatures. An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten. The difference from this alloy to the others is that this alloy represents a high resilience modulus while maintaining its refractory pro...\n\n---\n\n## Tungsten\nTungsten (also called wolfram) is a chemical element which has the symbol W (from German: Wolfram) and atomic number 74. It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.

Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter).

Named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.\nA relatively low-density body composed mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its dark leading hemisphere and its bright trailing hemisphere, as well as a massive equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Saturn\nSaturn has 274 confirmed moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Saturn's moons are diverse in size, ranging from tiny moonlets to Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and the second largest moon in the Solar System. Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit). They include the seven rounded satellites, and four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with some of the large moons. Fou...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere\u2014denser than Earth's\u2014and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km abo..."

He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.\nBell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices, which eventually culminated in his being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.\nMany other inventions marked Bell's later life, including ground-breaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics.

A common law joint-stock company, the Bell Telephone Company was started on the basis of holding \"potentially valuable patents\", principally Bell's master telephone U.S. patent 174,465. Upon inception, Hubbard was installed as trustee, although he was additionally the company's de facto president, since he also controlled his daughter's shares by power of attorney.

He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.\nBell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices, which eventually culminated in his being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.\nMany other inventions marked Bell's later life, including ground-breaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society a...\n\n---\n\n## Bell Telephone Company\nThe Bell Telephone Company was an American telecommunications company active from 1877 to 1899. It was the initial corporate entity from which the Bell System originated to build a continental conglomerate and monopoly in telecommunication services in the United States and Canada.\nThe company was organized in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 9, 1877, by Alexander Graham Bell's father-in-law Gardiner Greene Hubbard. A common law joint-stock company, the Bell Telephone Company was started on the basis of holding \"potentially valuable patents\", principally Bell's master telephone U.S. patent 174,465. Upon inception, Hubbard was installed as trustee, although he was additionally the company's de facto president, since he also controlled his daughter's shares by power of attorney. Thomas Sanders, its principal financial backer, was treasurer. Hubbard also organized the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, the first local operating company to offer service using Bell's telephone.\nBell ...\n\n---\n\n## Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy\nThe Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell controversy concerns the question of whether Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone independently. This issue is narrower than the question of who deserves credit for inventing the telephone, for which there are several claimants.\nAt issue are roles of each inventor's lawyers, the filing of patent documents, and allegations of theft."

The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing i..."

These symptoms usually pass within one or two weeks. A less common symptom is permanent paralysis, and possible death in extreme cases. Years after recovery, post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.\nPolio occurs naturally only in humans.

These organizations, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Gates Foundation, have spearheaded the campaign through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).

The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing i..."

Approximately 75% of cases are asymptomatic; mild symptoms which can occur include sore throat and fever; in a proportion of cases more severe symptoms develop such as headache, neck stiffness, and paresthesia. These symptoms usually pass within one or two weeks. A less common symptom is permanent paralysis, and possible death in extreme cases. Years after recovery, post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection.\nPolio occurs naturally only in humans. It is highly infectious, and is spread from person to person either through fecal\u2013oral transmission (e.g. poor hygiene, or by ingestion of food or water contaminated by human feces), or via the oral\u2013oral route.

These organizations, along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Gates Foundation, have spearheaded the campaign through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Successful eradication of infectious diseases has been achieved twice before, with smallpox in humans and rinderpest in ruminants.\nPrevention of disease spread is accomplished by vaccination. There are two kinds of polio vaccine\u2014oral polio vaccine (OPV), which uses weakened poliovirus, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is injected.

Within minutes of his announcement to the audience of scientists and reporters, news of the event was carried coast to coast by wire services and radio and television newscasts. When the vaccine was announced as successful, it led to spontaneous celebrations across the United States. It was the world's first successful polio vaccine, declared \"safe, effective, and potent.\" It was possibly the most significant biomedical advance of the twentieth century.\nIn 1954, the year leading up to the announcement, polio was killing more American children than any other infectious disease. Jonas Salk's vaccine was made ready for its third and final field tests. It became the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers.

He was born in New York City and attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine.\nIn 1947, Salk accepted a professorship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he undertook a project beginning in 1948 to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. For the next seven years, Salk devoted himself to developing a vaccine against polio.\nSalk was immediately hailed as a \"miracle worker\" when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it in order to maximize its global distribution. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the University of Pittsburgh looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, their patent attorney said, \"If there we...\n\n---\n\n## Polio vaccine\nPolio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio).

The list includes airlines founded before December 31, 1930.\nRows with a light-green background indicate the earliest predecessor company of an airline that is still operating, either as a parent company or a subsidiary company (many modern airline holding companies operate more than one airline). Of the airlines still operating, Air France has the oldest predecessor company, Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale transa\u00e9rienne, which was established in 1909 and began scheduled fixed-wing passenger operations in 1913. Another Air France predecessor, Lignes A\u00e9riennes Farman, began the first regular international passenger service in 1919. KLM is the oldest airline still operating under its original name, Koninklijke Luchtvaartmaatschappij, under which it was established in 1919 and began operating the following year.  \nThe date of the first airline service may differ from the foundation date of the company. \n\nFor airlines founded after 1930 see ...\n\n---\n\n## List of oldest companies\nThe oldest companies in the world are the brands and companies which remain operating (either in whole or in part) since inception, excluding associations and educational, government, or religious organizations.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## List of oldest universities in continuous operation\nThis is a list of the oldest existing universities in continuous operation in the world.\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time.

Associated with Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university and is known as one of the most prestigious universities for Islamic learning. In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students. As of 1996, over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.\nFounded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world.

It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857\u2013859 and subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later. The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II. Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention. They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963. UNE..."
