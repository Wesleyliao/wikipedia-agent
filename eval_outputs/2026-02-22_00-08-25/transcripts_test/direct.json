It is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the eastern, southern, and central regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, swamps and marshlands. It occasionally inhabits deltas, brackish lakes and rarely also saltwater. Its range once stretched from the Nile Delta throughout the Nile River. Lake Turkana in Kenya has one of the largest undisturbed Nile crocodile populations.\nGenerally, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11 ft 6 in and 16 ft 5 in) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg (496 to 1,653 lb). However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) in weight have been recorded. It is the largest predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile in the world, after the saltwater crocodile (Croco...\n\n---\n\n## White Nile\nThe White Nile (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 an-n\u012bl al-'abya\u1e0d) is a river in North and East Africa, the minor of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the larger being the Blue Nile.

At 7,088 km  long, it is the longest river in the world, although the volume of water it carries is much smaller than other major rivers such as the Amazon or Congo.   The Nile has played a central role in the environmental, economic, and cultural history of Africa for millennia.  The river's drainage basin covers portions of eleven countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is longer and is considered to be the headwaters, although the Blue Nile contributes over two thirds of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan; and the Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.
