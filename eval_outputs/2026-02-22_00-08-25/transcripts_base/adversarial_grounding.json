The One Ring first appeared as a plot device, a magic ring in Tolkien's children's fantasy novel, The Hobbit. Tolkien later gave it a backstory and much greater power: he added nineteen other Great Rings which also conferred powers such as invisibility, and which the One Ring could control. These were the Three Rings of the Elves, the Seven Rings for the Dwarves, and the Nine for Men. He stated that there were in addition many lesser rings with minor powers. A key story element in The Lord of the Rings is the addictive power of the One Ring, made secretly by the Dark Lord Sauron; the Nine Rings enslave their bearers as the Nazg\u00fbl (Ringwraiths), Sauron's most deadly servants.\nProposed sources of inspiration for the Rings of Power range from Germanic legend with the ring Andvaranaut and eventually Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, to fairy ...\n\n---\n\n## The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth is a 2004 real-time strategy video game developed by EA Los Angeles for Microsoft Windows.

These rings may have formed during the Ordovician impact spike approximately 466 million years ago. They were first formally proposed by a team of scientists working with the Monash University in September 2024, and have been a subject of interest for several years prior to the study. Transient rings have previously been suggested to explain climatic changes in the late-Eocene and Neoproterozoic. \n\n\n\n---\n\n## Rings of Power\nThe Rings of Power are magical artefacts in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, most prominently in his high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. The One Ring first appeared as a plot device, a magic ring in Tolkien's children's fantasy novel, The Hobbit. Tolkien later gave it a backstory and much greater power: he added nineteen other Great Rings which also conferred powers such as invisibility, and which the One Ring could control. These were the Three Rings of the Elves, the Seven Rings for the Dwarves, and the Nine for Men. He stated that there were in addition many lesser rings with minor powers. A key story element in The Lord of the Rings is the addictive power of the One Ring, made secretly by the Dark Lord Sauron; the Nine Rings enslave their bearers as the Nazg\u00fbl (Ringwraiths), Sauron's most deadly servants.\nProposed sources of inspiration for the Rings of Power range from Germanic legend with the ring Andvaranaut and eventually Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, to fairy ...\n\n---\n\n## The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth is a 2004 real-time strategy video game developed by EA Los Angeles for Microsoft Windows. The first part of the Middle-earth strategy game, It is based on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, in turn based on J. R. R. Tolkien's original novel. The game uses short video clips from the movies and a number of the voice actors, including the hobbits and wizards. It uses the SAGE engine. The sequel, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, was released on March 2, 2006.\nThe official game servers for The Battle for Middle-earth were permanently closed on December 31, 2010 by EA Games, due to the expiration of The Lord of the Rings video game license, however the players can still play it online using unofficial game servers."

        "output": "## Edison light bulb\nEdison light bulbs, also known as filament light bulbs and retroactively referred to as antique light bulbs or vintage light bulbs, are either carbon- or early tungsten-filament incandescent light bulbs, or modern bulbs that reproduce their appearance. Most of the bulbs in circulation are reproductions of the wound filament bulbs made popular by Edison Electric Light Company at the turn of the 20th century. They are easily identified by the long and complicated windings of their internal filaments, and by the very warm-yellow glow of the light they produce (many of the bulbs emit light at a color temperature of 2200\u20132400 K).\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Incandescent light bulb\nAn incandescent light bulb, also known as an incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe, is an electric light that produces illumination by Joule heating a filament until it glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current.

He is known as an independent early developer of a successful incandescent light bulb, and is responsible for developing the first use of incandescent lights used to illuminate homes and public buildings, including the Savoy Theatre, London, in 1881.\nIn 1904, Swan was knighted by King Edward VII, awarded the Royal Society's Hughes Medal, and was made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. He had received the highest decoration in France, the Legion of Honour, when he visited the 1881 International Exposition of Electricity, Paris. The exhibition included displays of his inventions, and the city was lit with his electric lighting."

It was first illuminated in 1901, and has only been turned off a few brief times since. It is located at 4550 East Avenue, Livermore, California, and is open to public viewing. Due to its longevity, the bulb has been noted by The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, and General Electric. The light has been the subject of many TV shows and news reports along with at least four books, and has its own website.\nThe handmade lightbulb was originally manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company of Shelby, Ohio, towards the end of the 1890s and donated to the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department in 1901. It has been relocated several times since and remains in the care of the fire department to this day.

The regulations are generally based on efficiency, rather than use of incandescent technology.\nIn 2009, the European Union and several other nations began the process of banning incandescent bulbs. In the early to mid 2010s, the bans continued in various other nations. In 2023, the United States banned most general service incandescent lamps, but had exclusions for specific bulb implementations.\nObjections to banning incandescent light bulbs include the higher initial cost of alternatives, lower quality of light of fluorescent lamps, and concerns of government overreach.

It was developed by Thomas Edison (1847\u20131931), patented in 1881, and was licensed in 1909 under General Electric's Mazda trademark. The bulbs have right-hand threaded metal bases (caps) which screw into matching threaded sockets (lamp holders). For bulbs powered by AC current, the thread is generally connected to neutral and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to the \"live\" phase.\nIn North America and continental Europe, Edison screws displaced other socket types for general lighting. In the early days of electrification, Edison screws were the only standard connector, and appliances other than light bulbs were connected to AC power via lamp sockets. Today Edison screw sockets comply with international standards.\nTheir types are designated as \"Exx\", such as \"E26\", where \"xx\" indicates the diameter of the socket in millimeters.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Incandescent light bulb\nAn incandescent light bulb, also known as an incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe, is an electric light that produces illumination by Joule heating a filament until it glows.

These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.\nEdison was raised in the American Midwest. Early in his career he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He went into business and became wealthy.

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \nThe collective fortifications c...\n\n---\n\n## History of the Great Wall of China\nThe history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771\u2013476 BC) and Warring States periods (475\u2013221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\nLater dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550\u2013574), the Jurchen-ruled Jin (1115\u20131234), and particularly the Ming (1369\u20131644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618..."

Under the known laws of physics, anti-gravity is impossible except possibly between matter and antimatter. Experimental measurements rule out repulsion between antihydrogen and the mass of the Earth.\nAnti-gravity does not refer to either the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism, aerodynamic lift, or ion-propelled \"lifters\", which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.\nAnti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction.\n\n---\n\n## Gravity\nIn physics, gravity (from Latin  gravitas 'weight'), also known as gravitation or a gravitational interaction, is a fundamental interaction, which may be described as the force that draws material objects towards each other.\nThe gravitational attraction between clouds of primordial hydrogen and clumps of dark matter in the early universe caused the hydrogen gas to coalesce, eventually condensing and fusing to form stars. At larger scales this resulted in galaxies and clusters, so gravity is a primary driver for the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.\nGravity is described by the general theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing\u2014not even light\u2014can escape once past the black hole...\n\n---\n\n## Massive gravity\nIn theoretical physics, massive gravity is a theory of gravity that modifies general relativity by endowing the graviton with a nonzero mass. In the classical theory, this means that gravitational waves obey a massive wave equation and hence travel at speeds below the speed of light."

The question was a major intellectual controversy, beginning in 1699 and reaching its peak in 1712. Leibniz had published his work on calculus first, but Newton's supporters accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton's unpublished ideas. The modern consensus is that the two men independently developed their ideas. Their creation of calculus has been called arguably \"the greatest advance in mathematics that had taken place since the time of Archimedes.\"\nNewton stated he had begun working on a form of calculus (which he called \"The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series\") in 1666, at the age of 23, but the work was not published until 1737 as a minor annotation in the back of one of his works decades later (a relevant Newton manuscript of October 1666 is now published am..."

Under the known laws of physics, anti-gravity is impossible except possibly between matter and antimatter. Experimental measurements rule out repulsion between antihydrogen and the mass of the Earth.\nAnti-gravity does not refer to either the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism, aerodynamic lift, or ion-propelled \"lifters\", which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.\nAnti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction.\n\n---\n\n## Gravity\nIn physics, gravity (from Latin  gravitas 'weight'), also known as gravitation or a gravitational interaction, is a fundamental interaction, which may be described as the force that draws material objects towards each other.\nThe gravitational attraction between clouds of primordial hydrogen and clumps of dark matter in the early universe caused the hydrogen gas to coalesce, eventually condensing and fusing to form stars. At larger scales this resulted in galaxies and clusters, so gravity is a primary driver for the large-scale structures in the universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.\nGravity is described by the general theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915, which describes gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing\u2014not even light\u2014can escape once past the black hole...\n\n---\n\n## Massive gravity\nIn theoretical physics, massive gravity is a theory of gravity that modifies general relativity by endowing the graviton with a nonzero mass. In the classical theory, this means that gravitational waves obey a massive wave equation and hence travel at speeds below the speed of light."

At the same time (according to Edmond Halley's contemporary report) Hooke agreed that \"the Demonstration of the Curves generated thereby\" was wholly Newton's.\nThe modern view is that the hypothesis of the inverse square relation was known before either Newton or Hooke came to be involved. Newton's work, by reasoning along multiple avenues and casting the relationship in mathematical terms converted this hypothesis into an inverse square law, in modern terms a scientific theory, and refined to the point of abstraction. Hooke's work lacked mathematical rigor and was inconsistent in its physical reasoning.\nNewton gave credit in his Principia to two people: Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus (who wrote without proo...\n\n---\n\n## Isaac Newton\nSir Isaac Newton ( ; 4 January [O.S. 25 December] 1643 \u2013 31 March [O.S. 20 March] 1727) was an English polymath who was a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, author and inventor. He was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with the German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for formulating infinitesimal calculus, although he developed calculus years before Leibniz. Newton contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.\nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries u...\n\n---\n\n## Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy\nIn the history of calculus, the calculus controversy (German: Priorit\u00e4tsstreit, lit.\u2009'priority dispute') was an argument between mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over who had first invented calculus. The question was a major intellectual controversy, beginning in 1699 and reaching its peak in 1712. Leibniz had published his work on calculus first, but Newton's supporters accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton's unpublished ideas. The modern consensus is that the two men independently developed their ideas. Their creation of calculus has been called arguably \"the greatest advance in mathematics that had taken place since the time of Archimedes.\"\nNewton stated he had begun working on a form of calculus (which he called \"The Method of Fluxions and Infinite Series\") in 1666, at the age of 23, but the work was not published until 1737 as a minor annotation in the back of one of his works decades later (a relevant Newton manuscript of October 1666 is now published am..."

His expeditions were the first known European contact with the Caribbean and Central and South America.\nThe name Christopher Columbus is the anglicization of the Latin Christophorus Columbus. Growing up on the coast of Liguria, he went to sea at a young age and traveled widely, as far north as the British Isles and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, who bore a son, Diego, and was based in Lisbon for several years.

They are known primarily for tourism and as an offshore financial centre. The resident population in 2023 was estimated by The World Factbook at 59,367, making it the third-largest of the British overseas territories by population. However, according to a Department of Statistics estimate in 2022, the population was 47,720.\nThe islands are southeast of Mayaguana in the Bahamas island chain and north of the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). Cockburn Town, the capital since 1766, is situated on Grand Turk about 1,042 kilometres (647 mi) east-southeast of Miami.

As one of the Seven Summits, Kilimanjaro is a major hiking and climbing destinatio...\n\n---\n\n## Seven Summits\nThe Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each of the seven traditional continents. On 30 April 1985, Richard Bass became the first climber to reach the summit of all seven.\nIn January 2023, Climbing said \"Today, the Seven Summits are a relatively common\u2014almost clich\u00e9\u2014tour of each continent's highest peak\", and while reaching the peak of the \"Seven Summits\" is no longer considered a significant achievement amongst mountaineers, it remains a popular challenge for \"adventure mountaineers\" using expedition climbing techniques."

It is a gas giant with a mass nearly 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is 11 times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\nJupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior.

The lower limit of mass for Jupiter-like planets is not well defined as it can be as low of 0.8-0.3 Jupiter masses to include  planets like Saturn.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Jupiter\nThere are 97 known moons of the planet Jupiter. This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes. All together, Jupiter's moons form a satellite system, colloquially referred to as the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus.

It is a gas giant with a mass nearly 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is 11 times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\nJupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with a denser interior. It contains traces of the elements carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon, and compounds such as ...\n\n---\n\n## Jupiter analogue\nJupiter analogues, also known as Jupiter-like planets, are exoplanets that are similar to the planet Jupiter, the fifth and largest planet in the Solar System. They are often defined as planets that has at least 1 Jupiter mass or larger and orbits its host star at a distance 3 to 12 astronomical units (AU), roughly one to a few times that of the systems snow line. The lower limit of mass for Jupiter-like planets is not well defined as it can be as low of 0.8-0.3 Jupiter masses to include  planets like Saturn.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Jupiter\nThere are 97 known moons of the planet Jupiter. This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes. All together, Jupiter's moons form a satellite system, colloquially referred to as the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all of which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 93 known moons and the rings together co..."

It is widely considered one of the greatest plays of all time.

His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, 3 long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
