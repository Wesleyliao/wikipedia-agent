At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance.

A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current.

At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.

An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\nIncandescent bulbs are much less ...\n\n---\n\n## Timeline of chemical element discoveries\nThe discoveries of the 118 chemical elements known to exist as of 2026 are presented here in chronological order.

Organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which had been created by French aristocrat Pierre de Coubertin, the event was held in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896.\nFourteen nations (according to the IOC, though the number is subject to interpretation) and 241 athletes (all males; this number is also disputed) took part in the games. Participants were all European or living in Europe, with the exception of the United States team, and over 65% of the competing athletes were Greek. Winners were given a silver medal, while runners-up received a copper medal. Retroactively, the IOC has designated the top three finishers in each event as gold, silver, and bronze medalists.

Petipa and Minkus revised the ballet into a more elaborate and expansive version in five acts and eleven scenes for the Mariinsky Ballet, first presented on 21 November [O.S. 9 November] 1871 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre of St. Petersburg.\nAll modern productions of the Petipa/Minkus ballet are derived from the version staged by Alexander Gorsky for the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in 1900, a production the ballet master staged for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg in 1902.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## The Man Who Killed Don Quixote\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote is a 2018 adventure\u2013comedy film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, loosely based on the 1605/1615 novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. Gilliam tried to make the film many times over 29 years, which made it an infamous example of development hell.\nGilliam started work on the film in 1989 but was unable to secure funding until 1998 when it entered full pre-production with a budget of $32.1 million without American financing, with Jean Rochefort as Quixote, Johnny Depp as Toby Grummett \u2013 a 21st-century marketing executive thrown back through time \u2013 and Vanessa Paradis as the female lead. Shooting began in 2000 in Navarre, but difficulties such as sets and equipment being destroyed by flooding, the departure of Rochefort due to illness, problems obtaining insurance for the production and other financial difficulties led to a sudden suspension of the production and its subsequent cancellation. The original production was th..."

Here's why it differs from its neighbors:\n\n1. **Different Colonial Power**: While most of South America was colonized by **Spain** (and therefore Spanish is the dominant language), **Portugal** colonized Brazil. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided the Americas into Castilian (Spanish) and Portuguese territorial spheres, giving Portugal control over what became Brazil.\n\n2. **Brazilian Portuguese Distinctiveness**: Even though Portuguese is Brazil's language, Brazilian Portuguese has developed distinctly different characteristics from European Portuguese, particularly in phonology and prosody (sound and rhythm patterns). This makes it notably different not only from Spanish-speaking neighbors but also from Portuguese as spoken in Portugal and African Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\n3. **Indigenous Languages**: Brazil does have over 200 indigenous languages and immigrant languages (Italian, German, Japanese), but Portuguese remains overwhelmingly dominant, unlike some neighboring countries that recognize multiple official indigenous languages.\n\nThis unique combination of Portuguese colonial history, combined with Brazil's geographic isolation and large population, has made Portuguese the defining linguistic characteristic of Brazil, setting it apart from its Spanish-speaking South American neighbors.",

This has contributed to a notable difference in the relationship between written, formal language and spoken forms in Brazilian Portuguese. The differences between formal written Portuguese and informal spoken varieties in Brazilian Portuguese have been documented in sociolinguistic studies. Some scholars, including Mario A. Perini, hav...\n\n---\n\n## Portuguese Brazilians\nPortuguese Brazilians (Portuguese: luso-brasileiros) are Brazilian citizens whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in Portugal. Most of the Portuguese who arrived throughout the centuries in Brazil sought economic opportunities. Although present since the onset of the colonization, Portuguese people began migrating to Brazil in larger numbers and without state support in the 18th century.\n\n---\n\n## Portuguese colonization of the Americas\nPortuguese colonization of the Americas (Portuguese: Coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o portuguesa das Am\u00e9ricas) constituted territories in the Americas belonging to the Kingdom of Portugal. Portugal was the leading country in the European exploration of the world in the 15th century. The Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494 divided the Earth outside Europe into Castilian and Portuguese global territorial hemispheres for exclusive conquest and colonization. Portugal colonized parts of South America (Brazil, Uruguay), but also made some unsuccessful attempts to colonize North America (Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia in Canada)."

Here's why it differs from its neighbors:\\n\\n1. **Different Colonial Power**: While most of South America was colonized by **Spain** (and therefore Spanish is the dominant language), **Portugal** colonized Brazil. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided the Americas into Castilian (Spanish) and Portuguese territorial spheres, giving Portugal control over what became Brazil.\\n\\n2. **Brazilian Portuguese Distinctiveness**: Even though Portuguese is Brazil's language, Brazilian Portuguese has developed distinctly different characteristics from European Portuguese, particularly in phonology and prosody (sound and rhythm patterns). This makes it notably different not only from Spanish-speaking neighbors but also from Portuguese as spoken in Portugal and African Portuguese-speaking countries.\\n\\n3. **Indigenous Languages**: Brazil does have over 200 indigenous languages and immigrant languages (Italian, German, Japanese), but Portuguese remains overwhelmingly dominant, unlike some neighboring countries that recognize multiple official indigenous languages.\\n\\nThis unique combination of Portuguese colonial history, combined with Brazil's geographic isolation and large population, has made Portuguese the defining linguistic characteristic of Brazil, setting it apart from its Spanish-speaking South American neighbors.\", type='text')"

It forms the tip of the submarine volcano Empedocles, 30 km (19 mi) south of Sicily, which is one of a number of underwater volcanoes known as the Campi Flegrei del Mar di Sicilia. \nThe island has emerged from sea level four times in recorded history. Seamount eruptions have raised it from the surface before erosion submerged it again. The last prominent appearance occurred in July 1831, when the island emerged above sea level for six months. During that time, a four-way dispute over the island's sovereignty arose, which remained unresolved.\nThe island is still referenced on marine charts, as its top is only 6 metres (20 feet) short of breaking the surface; it thus becomes a potentially dangerous hidden obstacle for many seafaring vessels, whose keels most often run deeper than this. It is also a small shoal on which near-surface maritime creatures dwell.\n\n---\n\n## List of islands in the Mediterranean\nThe Mediterranean Sea basin is estimated to host more than 10,000 islands, with 2,217 islands larger than 0.01 km2.

In addition to numerous small islands, large and small groups of islands, and islets, it includes the large islands of Cuba, bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean; of Jamaica, Hispaniola, and of Puerto Rico. All of these islands are among the West Indian islands that separate the American Mediterranean from the Atlantic O...\n\n---\n\n## Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)\nGraham Island (Italian: Isola Ferdinandea; French: \u00cele Julia) is a submerged volcanic island in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily. It forms the tip of the submarine volcano Empedocles, 30 km (19 mi) south of Sicily, which is one of a number of underwater volcanoes known as the Campi Flegrei del Mar di Sicilia. \nThe island has emerged from sea level four times in recorded history. Seamount eruptions have raised it from the surface before erosion submerged it again. The last prominent appearance occurred in July 1831, when the island emerged above sea level for six months. During that time, a four-way dispute over the island's sovereignty arose, which remained unresolved.\nThe island is still referenced on marine charts, as its top is only 6 metres (20 feet) short of breaking the surface; it thus becomes a potentially dangerous hidden obstacle for many seafaring vessels, whose keels most often run deeper than this. It is also a small shoal on which near-surface maritime creatures dwell.\n\n---\n\n## List of islands in the Mediterranean\nThe Mediterranean Sea basin is estimated to host more than 10,000 islands, with 2,217 islands larger than 0.01 km2. The two main island countries in the region are Malta and Cyprus, while other countries with islands in the Mediterranean Sea include Albania, Algeria, Croatia, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Montenegro, Spain, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey."

Designated rights of an official language can be created in written form or by historic usage.\nAn official language is recognized by 178 countries, of which 101 recognize more than one. The government of Italy made Italian their official language in 1999, and some nations (such as Mexico and Australia) have never declared de jure official languages at the national level.

It is an abjad, a writing system where only consonants are obligatorily written, a trait shared with its predecessor, Proto-Sinaitic, as well as some of its sibling writing systems, including Arabic and Hebrew.  It is a predecessor of the Ge'ez script, and a sibling script of the Phoenician alphabet and, through that, the modern Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets.\n\nThe script is really two variants: the monumental and the minuscule script, the former for inscriptions, the latter scratched with wooden sticks.

In humans the femur is the  largest and thickest bone in the body.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Human leg\nThe human leg is the lower limb of the human body, including the thigh, knee, lower leg, ankle, foot, or sometimes even the hip or buttock region.

The lower leg includes the shin in the front and the calf at the back.\nLegs are used for standing, many forms of human movement, recreation such as dancing, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. Evolution has led to the human leg's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait.

Absolute largest, and largest in relation to its body size. This distinction is critical in evolutionary biology, as traits like the extremely long tail feathers of the ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), which are the longest in relation to body size of any bird, are often the result of intense sexual selection."

In children, bone age serves as a measure of physiological maturity and aids in the diagnosis of growth abnormalities, endocrine disorders, and other medical conditions. As a person grows from fetal life through childhood, puberty, and finishes growth as a young adult, the bones of the skeleton change in size and shape. These changes can be seen by x-ray and other imaging techniques.

To move from one support to another, it pushes off from one vertical support with its hindlimbs, landing on another vertical support after an extended period of free flight. Vertical clinging and leaping primates have evolved a specialized anatomy to compensate for the physical implications of this form of locomotion. These key morphological specializations have been identified in prosimian fossils from as early as the Eocene."

By the 1980s, H. habilis was proposed to have been a human ancestor, directly evolving into Homo erectus, which directly led to modern humans. This viewpoint is now debated.

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \"arm lizard\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \"deep chest\".

It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods.

It is measured using a stadiometer, in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system, or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system. In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height measuring techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.\nHeight is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size.

Since antiquity, discoveries have been reported of gigantic human skeletons. Originally thought to belong to mythical giants, these bones were later identified as the exaggerated remains of prehistoric animals, usually whales or elephants. Regular reports in American newspapers in the 18th and 19th centuries of giant human skeletons may have inspired the case of the \"petrified\" Cardiff Giant, an archaeological hoax."

            "content": "## Femur\nThe femur (; pl.: femurs or femora ), or thigh bone is the only bone in the thigh \u2014 the region of the lower limb between the hip and the knee. In many four-legged animals, the femur is the upper bone of the hindleg.\nThe top of the femur fits into a socket in the pelvis called the hip joint, and the bottom of the femur connects to the shinbone (tibia) and kneecap (patella) to form the knee. In humans the femur is the  largest and thickest bone in the body.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Human leg\nThe human leg is the lower limb of the human body, including the thigh, knee, lower leg, ankle, foot, or sometimes even the hip or buttock region. There are thirty bones in each leg. The major bones are the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shinbone), and adjacent fibula.\nThe part of the leg between the hip and the knee is called the thigh. The part between the knee and the ankle is called the lower leg, shank, crus, or in anatomy simply the leg. The lower leg includes the shin in the front and the calf at the back.\nLegs are used for standing, many forms of human movement, recreation such as dancing, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. Evolution has led to the human leg's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait. While the capacity to walk upright is not unique to humans, other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy. In humans, female legs generally have greater hip anteversion and tibiofem...\n\n---\n\n## Largest body parts\nThe largest body part is either the largest given body part across all living and extinct organisms or the largest example of a body part within an existing species. The largest animals on the planet are not the only ones to have large body parts, with some smaller animals actually having one particularly enlarged area of the body.\nFurthermore, there are two kinds of body parts described in this article. Absolute largest, and largest in relation to its body size. This distinction is critical in evolutionary biology, as traits like the extremely long tail feathers of the ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), which are the longest in relation to body size of any bird, are often the result of intense sexual selection."

            "content": "## Bone age\nBone age is the degree of a person's skeletal development. In children, bone age serves as a measure of physiological maturity and aids in the diagnosis of growth abnormalities, endocrine disorders, and other medical conditions. As a person grows from fetal life through childhood, puberty, and finishes growth as a young adult, the bones of the skeleton change in size and shape. These changes can be seen by x-ray and other imaging techniques. A comparison between the appearance of a patient's bones to a standard set of bone images known to be representative of the average bone shape and size for a given age can be used to assign a \"bone age\" to the patient.\nBone age is distinct from an individual's biological or chronological age, which is the amount of time that has elapsed since birth. Discrepancies between bone age and biological age can be seen in people with stunted growth, where bone age may be less than biological age. Similarly, a bone age that is older than a person's chronolog...\n\n---\n\n## Salish Wool Dog\nThe Salish Wool Dog, also known as the Comox dog or Clallam Indian Dog, is an extinct breed of white, long-haired, Spitz-type dog that was developed and bred by the Coast Salish peoples of what is now Washington state and British Columbia for textile production.\n\n---\n\n## Vertical clinging and leaping\nVertical clinging and leaping (VCL) is a type of arboreal locomotion seen most commonly among the strepsirrhine primates and haplorrhine tarsiers.  The animal begins at rest with its torso upright and elbows fixed, with both hands clinging to a vertical support, such as the side of a tree or bamboo stalk.  To move from one support to another, it pushes off from one vertical support with its hindlimbs, landing on another vertical support after an extended period of free flight. Vertical clinging and leaping primates have evolved a specialized anatomy to compensate for the physical implications of this form of locomotion. These key morphological specializations have been identified in prosimian fossils from as early as the Eocene."

Details of structures vary tremendously from breed to breed, more than in any other animal species, wild or domesticated, as dogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier that stood only 6.3 cm (2.5 in) at the shoulder, 9.5 cm (3.7 in) in length along the head and body, and weighed only 113 grams (4.0 oz). The heaviest dog was an English Mastiff named Zorba, which weighed 314 pounds (142 kg). The tallest known adult dog is a Great Dane that stands 106.7 cm (42.0 in) at the shoulder.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Homo habilis\nHomo habilis (lit. 'handy man') is an extinct species of archaic human from the Early Pleistocene of East and South Africa about 2.4 million years ago to 1.65 million years ago (mya). It is among the oldest species of archaic humans. Suggestions for pushing back the age to 2.8 Mya were made in 2015 based on the discovery of a jawbone. Upon species description in 1964, H. habilis was highly contested, with many researchers recommending it be synonymised with Australopithecus africanus, the only other early hominin known at the time, but H. habilis received more recognition as time went on and more relevant discoveries were made. By the 1980s, H. habilis was proposed to have been a human ancestor, directly evolving into Homo erectus, which directly led to modern humans. This viewpoint is now debated. Several specimens with insecure species identification were assigned to H. habilis, leading to arguments for splitting, namely into \"H. rudolfensis\" and \"H. gautengensis\" of which only the f...\n\n---\n\n## Lucy (hominid)\nAL 288-1, commonly known as Lucy or Dink\u02bcinesh (Amharic: \u12f5\u1295\u1245 \u1290\u123d, lit.\u2009'you are marvellous'), is a collection of several hundred pieces of fossilized bone comprising 40 percent of the skeleton of a female of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. It was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at Hadar, a site in the Awash Valley of the Afar Triangle, by Donald Johanson, a paleoanthropologist of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.\nLucy is an early australopithecine and is dated to about 3.2 million years ago. The skeleton presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes, plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal and upright, akin to that of humans (and other hominins); this combination supports the view of human evolution that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size. A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was, at least partly, tree-dwelling, though the extent of this is debated.\nLucy was named by Pamela Alderman after the 1967 song \"Lucy in the Sky w..."

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \"arm lizard\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \"deep chest\". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons (31.2 to 51.7 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.\nBrachiosaurus is the namesake genus of the family Brach...\n\n---\n\n## Human height\nHuman height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect. It is measured using a stadiometer, in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system, or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system. In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height measuring techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.\nHeight is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous ins...\n\n---\n\n## List of tallest people\nThis is a list of the tallest people, verified by Guinness World Records or other reliable sources.\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Robert Wadlow of the United States (1918\u20131940) was the tallest person in recorded history, measuring 272 cm (8 ft 11 in) at the time of his death.\nThere are reports about even taller people but most claims are unverified or erroneous. Since antiquity, discoveries have been reported of gigantic human skeletons. Originally thought to belong to mythical giants, these bones were later identified as the exaggerated remains of prehistoric animals, usually whales or elephants. Regular reports in American newspapers in the 18th and 19th centuries of giant human skeletons may have inspired the case of the \"petrified\" Cardiff Giant, an archaeological hoax."

Political borders can be established through warfare, colonization, or mutual agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas.\nSome borders\u2014such as most states' internal administrative borders, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area\u2014are open and completely unguarded. Most external political borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints; adjacent border zones may also be controlled.

Lying at 6,225 ft (1,897 m) above sea level, Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America, and at 122,160,280 acre\u22c5ft (150.7 km3) it trails only the five Great Lakes as the largest by volume in the United States. Its depth is 1,645 ft (501 m), making it the second deepest in the United States after Crater Lake in Oregon (1,949 ft or 594 m).\nThe lake was formed about two million years ago as part of the Lake Tahoe Basin, and its modern extent was shaped during the ice ages. It is known for the clarity of its water and the panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides. The area surrounding the lake is also referred to as Lake Tahoe, or simply Tahoe; its English name is derived from its Washo name, D\u00e1\u0294aw.

Roosevelt\nThe president of the United States may take any of several kinds of executive actions. \n\nExecutive orders are issued to help officers and agencies of the executive branch manage the operations within the federal government itself. Presidential memoranda are closely related, and have the force of law on the Executive Branch, but are generally considered less prestigious. Presidential memoranda do not have an established process for issuance, and unlike executive orders, they are not numbered. A presidential determination results in an official policy or position of the executive branch of the United States government. A presidential proclamation is a statement issued by a president on a matter of public policy, under specific authority granted to the president by Congress, typically on a matter of widespread interest. Administrative orders are signed documents such as notices, letters, and orders, that can be issued to conduct administrative operations of the federal government.

Mexico covers 1,972,550 km2 (761,610 sq mi), and is the thirteenth-largest country in the world by land area. With a population exceeding 130 million, Mexico is the tenth-most populous country in the world and is home to the largest number of native Spanish speakers as of 2020. Mexico City is the capital and largest city, which ranks among the most populous metropolitan areas in the world.\nHuman presence in Mexico dates back to at least 8,000 BC. Mesoamerica, considered a cradle of civilization, was home to numerous advanced societies, including the Olmecs, Maya, Zapotecs, Teotihuacan civilization, and Pur\u00e9pecha.

Let me provide it:\\n\\n**The oldest university in the world that is still operating is the University of Bologna, located in Bologna, Italy.**\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, the University of Bologna is \"the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the first degree-awarding institution of higher learning.\" Teaching began around 1088, with the university becoming formally organized as a universitas scholarium (guilds of students) by the late 12th century. The university\\'s emblem carries the date A.D. 1088.\\n\\nToday, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe, with over 90,000 students, and it maintains the motto \"Alma Mater Studiorum\" (Latin for \"Nourishing mother of studies\").\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that while the University of al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco was founded earlier (857-859 CE as a mosque), scholars distinguish between it and the University of Bologna based on how \"university\" is defined. Al-Qarawiyyin operated as a madrasa (Islamic teaching institution) rather than a university in the formal European sense, and was only officially incorporated into the modern university system and reorganized in 1963.', type='text')"

It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange color (though the origin of this color is still unknown). Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces extremely powerful wind speeds of up to 432 km/h (268 mph).\n\n## How Long Has It Been Observed?\n\nThe observations of the Great Red Spot span quite a long period:\n\n- **First recorded observation**: September 1831\n- **Early observations**: 60 recorded observations between 1831 and 1878, when continuous observations began\n- **Duration**: Based on definitive records, it has been continuously observed for approximately **190+ years** (from 1878 to present)\n\n**Important note**: There is historical evidence of a similar spot observed from 1665 to 1713. If this were the same storm, it would have existed for at least 361 years. However, a 2024 study suggests that the 17th-century spot was likely not the same as the current Great Red Spot.\n\n**Source**: Wikipedia article on the Great Red Spot",

In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe. Like Jupiter's spot, the Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms. However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot.
