This was partly because Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system.\nThe business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft's antitrust trial, wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice. The decision came too late for Netscape, however, as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows.\nThe Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997.

This was partly because Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system.\nThe business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft's antitrust trial, wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft's bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice. The decision came too late for Netscape, however, as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows.\nThe Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in 1997. Netscape Communicator's 4.x source code was the base for the Netscape-developed Mozilla Application Suite, which was la..."

            "content": "## History of programming languages\nThe history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalk\u00fcl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado B\u00f6hm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Java (programming language)\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaini...\n\n---\n\n## Java (software platform)\nJava is a set of computer software and specifications that provides a software platform for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. Java applets, which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages.\nWriting in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed as byte code in a Java virtual machine (JVM); byte code compilers are also available for other languages, including Ada, JavaScript, Kotlin (Google's preferred Android language), Python, and Ruby. In addition, several languages have been designed to run natively on the JVM, including Clojure, Groovy, and Scala. Java syntax borrows heavily from C and C++, but object-orien..."

She inherited the throne aged 18 after her father's three elder brothers died without surviving legitimate issue. Victoria attempted privately to influence government policy ...\n\n---\n\n## Victoria\nVictoria most commonly refers to:\n\nQueen Victoria (1819\u20131901), Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India\nVictoria (state), a state of Australia\nVictoria, British Columbia, Canada, a provincial capital\nVictoria, Seychelles, the capital city of the Seychelles\nVictoria (mythology), Roman goddess of victory\nVictoria may also refer to:\n\n---\n\n## Victoria Wood\nVictoria Wood (19 May 1953 \u2013 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, musician, screenwriter, and director. Wood wrote and starred in dozens of sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms over several decades, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions which she performed at the piano. Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to activities, attitudes and products that are considered to exemplify Britain. She was noted for her skills in observational comedy and in satirising aspects of social class.\nWood started her career in 1974 by appearing on, and winning, the ATV talent show New Faces. She established herself as a comedy star in the 1980s, winning a BAFTA TV Award in 1986 for the sketch series Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV (1985\u201387), and became one of Britain's most popular stand-up comics, winning a second BAFTA for An Audience with Victoria Wood (1988). In the 1990s, she wrote and co-starred in the television film Pa..."

The earliest known uses of the term \"board game\" are between the 1840s and 1850s.\nWhile game boards are a necessary and sufficient condition of this genre, card games that do not use a standard deck of cards, as well as games that use neither cards nor a game board, are often colloquially included, with some referring to this genre generally as \"table and board games\" or simply \"tabletop games\".\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Go (game)\nGo is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to fence off more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go, and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.\nThe playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other black stones. The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections (points) on the board. Once placed, stones may not be moved, but captured stones are immediately removed from the board. A single stone (or connected group of stones) is captured when surrounded by the opponent's stones on all orthogonally adjacent points. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move.\nWhen a game concl...\n\n---\n\n## Monopoly (game)\nMonopoly is a multiplayer economics-themed board game. In the game, players roll two dice (or one extra special red die depending on the game) to move around the game board, buying and trading properties and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents and aim to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards and tax squares. Players receive a salary every time they pass \"Go\" and can end up in jail, from which they cannot move until they have met one of three conditions. House rules, hundreds of different editions, many spin-offs, and related media exist.\nMonopoly has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed locally in more than 113 countries and printed in more than 46 languages. As of 2015, it was estimated that the game had sold 275 million copies worldwide. The properties on the original game board were named after locations in and around Atlantic City, New Jersey..."

The language makes no use of macros or preprocessor instructions. Features adopted from modern languages include the addition of compile time generic programming data types, allowing functions to work on a variety of data, along with a small set of new compiler directives to allow access to the information about those types using reflection. Zig requires manual memory management, but attempts to improve memory safety through option types and a unit testing framework. Features for low-level programming include packed structs, arbitrary-width integers and multiple pointer types.\nZig was designed by Andrew Kelley and first announced in 2016.

The earliest known uses of the term \"board game\" are between the 1840s and 1850s.\nWhile game boards are a necessary and sufficient condition of this genre, card games that do not use a standard deck of cards, as well as games that use neither cards nor a game board, are often colloquially included, with some referring to this genre generally as \"table and board games\" or simply \"tabletop games\".\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Go (game)\nGo is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to fence off more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 2,500 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game continuously played to the present day. A 2016 survey by the International Go Federation's 75 member nations found that there are over 46 million people worldwide who know how to play Go, and over 20 million current players, the majority of whom live in East Asia.\nThe playing pieces are called stones. One player uses the white stones and the other black stones. The players take turns placing their stones on the vacant intersections (points) on the board. Once placed, stones may not be moved, but captured stones are immediately removed from the board. A single stone (or connected group of stones) is captured when surrounded by the opponent's stones on all orthogonally adjacent points. The game proceeds until neither player wishes to make another move.\nWhen a game concl...\n\n---\n\n## Monopoly (game)\nMonopoly is a multiplayer economics-themed board game. In the game, players roll two dice (or one extra special red die depending on the game) to move around the game board, buying and trading properties and developing them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents and aim to drive them into bankruptcy. Money can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards and tax squares. Players receive a salary every time they pass \"Go\" and can end up in jail, from which they cannot move until they have met one of three conditions. House rules, hundreds of different editions, many spin-offs, and related media exist.\nMonopoly has become a part of international popular culture, having been licensed locally in more than 113 countries and printed in more than 46 languages. As of 2015, it was estimated that the game had sold 275 million copies worldwide. The properties on the original game board were named after locations in and around Atlantic City, New Jersey..."

It was introduced in a 2003 paper by Francis McCabe and Keith Clark.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Go (programming language)\nGo is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is statically typed and compiled. It is known for the simplicity of its syntax and the efficiency of development that it enables through the inclusion of a large standard library supplying many needs for common projects. It was designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, and publicly announced in November 2009. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang to avoid ambiguity and because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.\nThere are two major implementations:\n\nThe original, self-hosting compiler toolchain, initially developed inside Google;\nA frontend written in C++, called gofrontend, originally a GCC frontend, providing gccgo, a GCC-based Go compiler; later extended to also support LLVM, providing an LLVM-based Go compiler called gollvm.\nA third-party source-to-so...\n\n---\n\n## Zig (programming language)\nZig is a system programming language designed to be a general-purpose improvement to the C programming language. It is free and open-source software, released under an MIT License.\nDifferences with C relate to control flow, function calls, library imports, variable declaration and Unicode support. The language makes no use of macros or preprocessor instructions. Features adopted from modern languages include the addition of compile time generic programming data types, allowing functions to work on a variety of data, along with a small set of new compiler directives to allow access to the information about those types using reflection. Zig requires manual memory management, but attempts to improve memory safety through option types and a unit testing framework. Features for low-level programming include packed structs, arbitrary-width integers and multiple pointer types.\nZig was designed by Andrew Kelley and first announced in 2016. Development is funded by the Zig Software Foundation (..."

At its southern border, Apex encompasses the community of Friendship. In 1994, the downtown area was designated a historic district, and the Apex train depot, built in 1867, is designated a Wake County landmark. The depot location marks the highest point on the old Chatham Railroad, hence the town's name. The town motto is \"The Peak of Good Living\".\nIn the late 19th century, a small community developed around the railroad station. The forests were cleared for farmland, much of which was dedicated to tobacco farming. Since Apex was near the state capital, it became a trading center. The railroad shipped products such as lumber, tar, and tobacco. The town was officially incorporated in 1873. By 1900, the town had a population of 349.

Olympia is the state capital, and the most populous city is Seattle.\nWashington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the 13th-most populous state, with a population of over 8 million. The majority of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry on Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords and bays carved out by glaciers.

It is part of a larger administrative campus including buildings for the Washington Supreme Court, the Washington Governor's Mansion, and many other state agencies. It is owned and operated by the Department of Enterprise Services (DES).\nOlympia was chosen as the territorial capital in 1853 and a two-story building was constructed for use by the legislature beginning the following year. A permanent capitol building was planned following statehood in 1889, but construction stalled amid poor economic conditions. The state government moved to the existing county courthouse in Olympia in 1905, but it proved to be too small for the state's needs. Design of the permanent capitol resumed in 1911 and construction began the..."

The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River, and is considered the city's founding date.

It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, epistemology, mathematics, political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics. Greek philosophy continued throughout the Hellenistic period and later evolved into Roman philosophy.\nGreek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception, and can be found in many aspects of public education. Alfred North Whitehead once claimed: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\". Clear, unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers to Roman philosophy, early Islamic philosophy, medieval scholasticism, the European Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment.\nGreek philosophy was influenced to some extent by the older wisdom literature and mythological cosmogonies of the ancient Near East, though the e...\n\n---\n\n## List of ancient Greek philosophers\nThis list of ancient Greek philosophers contains philosophers who studied in ancient Greece or spoke Greek.

An innovator of the literary dialogue and dialectic forms, Plato influenced all the major areas of theoretical philosophy and practical philosophy, and was the founder of the Platonic Academy, a philosophical school in Athens where Plato taught the collection of philosophical theories that would later become known as Platonism. \nPlato's most famous contribution is his Theory of Forms (or Ideas), which aims to solve what is now known as the problem of universals. He was influenced by the pre-Socratic thinkers Pythagoras, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, although much of what is known about them is derived from Plato himself.\nAlong with his teacher Socrates, and his student Aristotle, Plato is a central figure in the history of Western philosophy.

The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar contextual development. The swifts' nearest relatives are the New World hummingbirds and the Southeast Asian treeswifts.\nIts scientific name Apus is Latin for a swift, thought by the ancients to be a type of swallow with no feet (from Ancient Greek \u03b1, a, \"without\", and \u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, pous, \"foot\").\nSwifts have very short legs which they use primarily for clinging to vertical surfaces (hence the German name Mauersegler, literally meaning \"wall-glider\"). They never settle voluntarily on the ground where they would be vulnerable to accidents and predation, and non-breeding individuals may spend up to ten months in continuous flight.\n\n---\n\n## Swift (bird)\nThe Apodidae, or swifts, form a family of highly aerial birds. They are superficially similar to swallows, but are not closely related to any passerine species. Swifts are placed in the order Apodiformes along with hummingbirds. The treeswifts are closely related to the true swifts, but form a separate family, the Hemiprocnidae.\nResemblances between swifts and swallows are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles based on catching insects in flight.\nThe family name, Apodidae, is derived from the Greek \u1f04\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 (\u00e1pous), meaning \"footless\", a reference to the small, weak legs of these most aerial of birds. The tradition of depicting swifts without feet continued into the Middle Ages, as seen in the heraldic martlet.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Swift Bird Creek\nSwift Bird Creek is a stream in the U.S. state of South Dakota.\nSwift Bird Creek has the name of Chief Swift Bird, a member of the Sioux tribe."

CIPS is backed by the People's Bank of China and was launched in 2015 as part of a policy effort to internationalize the use of China\u2019s currency.\nIn 2022, CIPS processed around 96.7 trillion yuan (US$14.03 trillion), with about 1427 financial institutions in 109 countries and regions having connected to the system.\nIn 2023, the CIPS processed 6.6133 million transactions, totaling RMB123.06 trillion(US$17.09 trillion), increasing by 50.29 percent and 27.27 percent y-o-y, respectively. On a daily basis, the system processed 25,900 transactions, totaling RMB482.602 billion(US$67.028 billion).\nIn 2024, the CIPS processed 8.2169 million transactions, totaling RMB175.49 trillion(US$24.47 trillion), increasing by 24.25 percent and 42.60 percent y-o-y, respectively.

BIC is also known as SWIFT-BIC, SWIFT ID, or SWIFT code, after the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which is designated by ISO as the BIC registration authority. BIC was defined originally as a Bank Identifier Code and is most often assigned to financial organizations; when it is assigned to a non-financial organization, the code may also be known as a Business Entity Identifier (BEI). These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements.\nThe overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN).

SC, is a cooperative established in 1973 in Belgium (French: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Coop\u00e9rative) and owned by the banks and other member firms that use its service. SWIFT provides the main messaging network through which international payments are initiated. It also sells software and services to financial institutions, mostly for use on its proprietary \"SWIFTNet\", and assigns ISO 9362 Business Identifier Codes (BICs), popularly known as \"SWIFT codes\".\nAs of 2018, around half of all high-value cross-border payments worldwide used the SWIFT network, and in 2015, SWIFT linked more than 11,000 financial institutions in over 200 countries and territories, who were exchanging an average of over 32 million messages per day (compared to an average of 2.4 million daily messages in 1995).\nSWIFT is headquartered in La Hulpe near Brussels. It hosts an annual conference, called Sibos, specifically aimed at the financial s..."
