The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaini...\n\n---\n\n## Outline of the Java programming language\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Java:\nJava is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented, class-based, strong, and statically typed programming language that is compiled to Java bytecode for execution on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), where you can write once and run anywhere. Java was designed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and was a core component of Sun's Java platform."

It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea (a part of Pacific Ocean) to the north. With a population of 156.9 million people (including Madura) in mid 2024, projected to have risen to 158 million by mid-2025, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population while constituting only 7% of its land area. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally.

Quick, agile, and powerful enough to take down the largest prey in the jungle, the jaguar is the biggest felid in Central or South America, and one of the most efficient and aggressive predators. Endowed with a spotted coat and well-adapted for the jungle, hunting either in the trees or water, making it one of the few felines tolerant of water, the jaguar was, and remains, revered among the Indigenous Americans who live in its range.\nAll major Mesoamerican civilizations prominently featured a jaguar god, and for many, such as the Olmec, the jaguar was an im...\n\n---\n\n## List of largest cats\nThis is a list of extant species in the Felidae family, which aims to evaluate their size, ordered by maximum reported weight and length or height, in wild individuals on record.

It is common for a half marathon event to be held concurrently with a marathon or a 5K race, using almost the same course with a late start, an early finish, or shortcuts.  If finisher medals are awarded, the medal or ribbon may differ from those for the full marathon. The half marathon is also known as a 21K, 21.1K, or 13.1 miles, although these values are rounded and not formally correct.\nA half marathon world record is officially recognised by World Athletics. The men's world record time is 57:30, set by Yomif Kejelcha in 2024 in Valencia, Spain. Jacob Kiplimo ran 56:42 in Barcelona but this mark was not ratified by World Athletics due to his proximity to the lead car. The women's world record, in a mixed-gender race, is 1:02:52, set by Letesenbet Gidey of Ethiopia in October 2021 in Valencia, Spain.
