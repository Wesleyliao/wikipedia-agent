At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value.

At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.

It shows in its compounds a wide variety of oxidation states ranging from \u22123 to +7.\nRhenium was originally discovered in 1908 by Masataka Ogawa, but he mistakenly assigned it as element 43 (now known as technetium) rather than element 75 and named it nipponium.

Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about..."

Titan is the only natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System with an atmosphere that is denser than the atmosphere of Earth and is one of two moons with an atmosphere significant enough to drive weather (the other being the atmosphere of Triton). Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, propane, PAHs and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, acetonitrile, argon and helium. The isotopic study of nitrogen isotopes ratio also suggests acetonitrile may be present in quantities exceeding hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene. The surface pressure is about 50% higher than on Earth at 1.5 bars (147 kPa). This is higher than the pressure at the triple point of m...\n\n---\n\n## Life on Titan\nWhether there is life on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is currently an open question and a topic of scientific assessment and research. Titan is far colder than Earth, but of all the places in the Solar System, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface. Its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are small and large bodies of both liquid methane and ethane, and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell. Some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide prebiotic chemistry for living cells different from those on Earth.\nIn June 2010, scientists analyzing data from the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes. The Cassini\u2013Huygens miss...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere\u2014denser than Earth's\u2014and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km abo..."

He also co-founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in 1885.\nBell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work. His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices, which eventually culminated in his being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone, on March 7, 1876. Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.\nMany other inventions marked Bell's later life, including ground-breaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society a...\n\n---\n\n## History of the telephone\nThis history of the telephone chronicles the development of the electrical telephone, and includes a brief overview of its predecessors.  The first telephone patent was granted to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876.\n\n---\n\n## Invention of the telephone\nThe invention of the telephone was the culmination of work done by many different people, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the conflicting patent claims made by several individuals and numerous companies. Notable people included in this process were Antonio Meucci, Philipp Reis, Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell."

It is spoken by nearly all of the 203 million inhabitants of Brazil, and widely across the Brazilian diaspora, consisting of approximately two million Brazilians who have emigrated to other countries.\n\nBrazilian Portuguese differs, particularly in phonology and prosody, from varieties spoken in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking African countries. In these latter countries, the language tends to have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese, influenced by the more recent end of Portuguese colonial rule. This has contributed to a notable difference in the relationship between written, formal language and spoken forms in Brazilian Portuguese. The differences between formal written Portuguese and informal spoken varieties in Brazilian Portuguese have been documented in sociolinguistic studies. Some scholars, including Mario A. Perini, hav...\n\n---\n\n## Languages of Brazil\nPortuguese is the official and national language of Brazil, being widely spoken by nearly all of its population. Brazil is the most populous Portuguese-speaking country in the world, with its lands comprising the majority of Portugal's former colonial holdings in the Americas.\nAside from Portuguese, the country also has numerous minority languages, including over 200 different indigenous languages, such as Nheengatu (a descendant of Tupi), and languages of more recent European and Asian immigrants, such as Italian, German and Japanese. In some municipalities, those minor languages have official status: Nheengatu, for example, is an official language in S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, while a number of German dialects are official in nine southern municipalities.\nHunsrik (also known as Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch) is a Germanic language also spoken in Argentina, Paraguay and Venezuela, which derived from the Hunsr\u00fcckisch dialect.

The term \"South American Spanish\" (Spanish: espa\u00f1ol sudamericano or espa\u00f1ol suramericano) is sometimes used as a broad name for the dialects of Spanish spoken on the continent, but such a term is only geographical and has little or no linguistic relevance. Spanish is the most widely spoken language of the South American continent, followed closely by Portuguese. \nThe diverse Spanish dialects of the continent have no unifying feature to set them apart from non-South American varieties. The Spanish of the Andean highlands is historically conservative, having some traits in common with the Spanish of central Mexico, while varieties spoken in Argentina and Venezuela share some phonological innovations with the Spanish spoken on Caribbean islands. In some cases a single South American country\u2014for example Colombia\u2014presents a broad spectrum of conservative and innovative dialects.\n\nAmazon...\n\n---\n\n## Spanish language in the Americas\nThe different dialects of the Spanish language spoken in the Americas are distinct from each other, as well as from those varieties spoken in the Iberian Peninsula \u2014collectively known as Peninsular Spanish\u2014 and Spanish spoken elsewhere, such as in Equatorial Guinea, Western Sahara, or in the Philippines. There is great diversity among the various Hispanic American vernaculars, as there are no common traits shared by all of them which are not also in existence in one or more of the variants of Iberian Spanish. A general Hispanic American \"standard\" does, however, vary from the Castilian \"standard\" register used in television, music and, notably, in the dubbing industry. Of the more than 498 million people who speak Spanish as their native language, more than 455 million are in Latin America, the United States and Canada, as of 2022. The total amount of native and non-native speakers of Spanish as of October 2022 well-exceeds 595 million.\nThere are numerous regional particularities and i..."

The title of \"world's tallest building\" has been held  by various buildings in modern times, including Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England, and the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, both in New York City.\nBefore the modern skyscraper era emerged, between c. 1311 and 1884 the tallest buildings and structures were mostly Christian churches and cathedrals. Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world until Lincoln Cathedral of 1311, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable.

The title of \"world's tallest building\" has been held  by various buildings in modern times, including Lincoln Cathedral in Lincoln, England, and the Empire State Building and the original World Trade Center, both in New York City.\nBefore the modern skyscraper era emerged, between c. 1311 and 1884 the tallest buildings and structures were mostly Christian churches and cathedrals. Prior to then, the tallest buildings in the world cannot be conclusively determined. For instance, the Lighthouse of Alexandria, which was completed in approximately 280 BC, has been estimated to have been 100 m (330 ft) tall, but its true height is not known. For thousands of years, the Great Pyramid in Egypt was the tallest structure in the world until Lincoln Cathedral of 1311, but the Great Pyramid is not considered a building since it is not habitable. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest stru...\n\n---\n\n## Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\nBas\u00edlica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, or simply Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is a church under construction in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world and designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. In 2005, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was added to an existing (1984) UNESCO World Heritage Site, \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\". On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.\nOn 19 March 1882, construction of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud\u00ed took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaud\u00ed devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the church's crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.\nRelying solely on private donations, Sagrada ..."

The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer).

The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing i..."

It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods.

It is also possible to estimate the stature from bones. Even measurements of parts of the body, such as a finger, can be used to estimate the stature.\nThe principle behind this forensic anthropology technique is the fact that for a given combination of age, race, and gender there measurements of different body parts which have a relationship to the stature. This relationship between the measurements of body parts was known to sculptors and artists. In modern times, regression formulae are used to estimate stature from bones, fragments of bones or measurements of body parts.\n\n---\n\n## Tyrannosaurus\nTyrannosaurus () is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The type species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning 'king' in Latin), often shortened to T. rex or colloquially t-rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of geological formations dating to the late Maastrichtian age of the late Cretaceous period, 69 to 66 million years ago, with isolated specimens possibly indicating an earlier origin in the middle Campanian age. It was one of the last known members of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event.\nLike other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but ..."

The first fossil, a tooth, was discovered in 1921, and Zhoukoudian has since become the most productive H. erectus site in the world. Peking Man was instrumental in the foundation of Chinese anthropology, and fostered an important dialogue between Western and Eastern science. Peking Man became the centre of anthropological discussion, and was classified as a direct human ancestor, propping up the Out of Asia theory that humans evolved in Asia.\nPeking Man also played a vital role in the restructuring of Chinese identity following the Chinese Communist Revolution, and it was used to introduce the general populace to Marxism and scien..."

It is the smaller of the two bones and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the knee joint and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\n\n---\n\n## Limbs of the horse\nThe limbs of the horse are structures made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that support the weight of the equine body. They include three apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep, and the reciprocal apparatus, which causes the hock to follow the motions of the stifle. The limbs play a major part in the movement of the horse, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures that provide blood flow through the lower leg.

The internal human body includes organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and blood, lymphatic vessels and lymph.\nThe study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar, iron, and oxygen in the blood.\nThe body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and artists to assist them in their work.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Human height\nHuman height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect. It is measured using a stadiometer, in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system, or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system. In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height measuring techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.\nHeight is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer.

Even measurements of parts of the body, such as a finger, can be used to estimate the stature.\nThe principle behind this forensic anthropology technique is the fact that for a given combination of age, race, and gender there measurements of different body parts which have a relationship to the stature. This relationship between the measurements of body parts was known to sculptors and artists. In modern times, regression formulae are used to estimate stature from bones, fragments of bones or measurements of body parts.\n\n---\n\n## Tyrannosaurus\nTyrannosaurus () is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The type species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning 'king' in Latin), often shortened to T. rex or colloquially t-rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of geological formations dating to the late Maastrichtian age of the late Cretaceous period, 69 to 66 million years ago, with isolated specimens possibly indicating an earlier origin in the middle Campanian age. It was one of the last known members of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event.\nLike other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but ..."

In many four-legged animals, the femur is the upper bone of the hindleg.\nThe top of the femur fits into a socket in the pelvis called the hip joint, and the bottom of the femur connects to the shinbone (tibia) and kneecap (patella) to form the knee.

The leg bone of a deceased person is used. Alternatively, the leg bone of a respected teacher may be used. The kangling may also be made out of wood.\nThe kangling should only be used in ch\u00f6d rituals performed outdoors with the ch\u00f6d damaru and bell. In Tantric ch\u00f6d practice, the practitioner, motivated by compassion, plays the kangling as a gesture of fearlessness, to summon hungry spirits and demons so that she or he may satisfy their hunger and thereby relieve their sufferings. It is also played as a way of \"cutting off of the ego.\"\n\nA minor figure from Katok Monastery, the First Chonyi Gyatso, Chopa Lugu (17th \u2013 mid-18th century), is remembered for his \"nightly bellowing of bone-trumpet [kangling] and shouting of ..."

The largest animals on the planet are not the only ones to have large body parts, with some smaller animals actually having one particularly enlarged area of the body.\nFurthermore, there are two kinds of body parts described in this article. Absolute largest, and largest in relation to its body size. This distinction is critical in evolutionary biology, as traits like the extremely long tail feathers of the ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), which are the longest in relation to body size of any bird, are often the result of intense sexual selection.\n\n---\n\n## List of tallest people\nThis is a list of the tallest people, verified by Guinness World Records or other reliable sources.\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Robert Wadlow of the United States (1918\u20131940) was the tallest person in recorded history, measuring 272 cm (8 ft 11 in) at the time of his death.\nThere are reports about even taller people but most claims are unverified or erroneous.

Its fossils have been found in a cave some 50 km (31 mi) southwest of Beijing (referred to in the West as Peking upon its first discovery), known as the Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site. The first fossil, a tooth, was discovered in 1921, and Zhoukoudian has since become the most productive H. erectus site in the world. Peking Man was instrumental in the foundation of Chinese anthropology, and fostered an important dialogue between Western and Eastern science. Peking Man became the centre of anthropological discussion, and was classified as a direct human ancestor, propping up the Out of Asia theory that humans evolved in Asia.\nPeking Man also played a vital role in the restructuring of Chinese identity following the Chinese Communist Revolution, and it was used to introduce the general populace to Marxism and scien..."

These ratios are used in depictions of the human figure and may become part of an artistic canon of body proportion within a culture. Academic art of the nineteenth century demanded close adherence to these reference metrics and some artists in the early twentieth century rejected those constraints and consciously mutated them.\n\n---\n\n## Fibula\nThe fibula (pl.: fibulae or fibulas) or calf bone is a leg bone on the lateral side of the tibia, to which it is connected above and below. It is the smaller of the two bones and, in proportion to its length, the most slender of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the knee joint and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\n\n---\n\n## Limbs of the horse\nThe limbs of the horse are structures made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that support the weight of the equine body. They include three apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep, and the reciprocal apparatus, which causes the hock to follow the motions of the stifle. The limbs play a major part in the movement of the horse, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures that provide blood flow through the lower leg.

It is composed of many different types of cells that together create tissues and subsequently organs and then organ systems. \nThe external human body consists of a head, hair, neck, torso (which includes the thorax and abdomen), genitals, arms, hands, legs, and feet. The internal human body includes organs, teeth, bones, muscle, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels and blood, lymphatic vessels and lymph.\nThe study of the human body includes anatomy, physiology, histology and embryology. The body varies anatomically in known ways. Physiology focuses on the systems and organs of the human body and their functions. Many systems and mechanisms interact in order to maintain homeostasis, with safe levels of substances such as sugar, iron, and oxygen in the blood.\nThe body is studied by health professionals, physiologists, anatomists, and artists to assist them in their work.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Human height\nHuman height or stature is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a human body, standing erect. It is measured using a stadiometer, in centimetres when using the metric system or SI system, or feet and inches when using United States customary units or the imperial system. In the early phase of anthropometric research history, questions about height measuring techniques for measuring nutritional status often concerned genetic differences.\nHeight is also important because it is closely correlated with other health components, such as life expectancy. Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature and a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure and are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the \"longevity gene\" FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of small body size. Short stature decreases the risk of venous ins...\n\n---\n\n## List of tallest people\nThis is a list of the tallest people, verified by Guinness World Records or other reliable sources.\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Robert Wadlow of the United States (1918\u20131940) was the tallest person in recorded history, measuring 272 cm (8 ft 11 in) at the time of his death.\nThere are reports about even taller people but most claims are unverified or erroneous.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".\nAt the time of the prize's announcement, Machado was in hiding inside Venezuela, fearing repression from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. She secretly escaped the country to reach Oslo with the help of international allies, but vowed to return to Venezuela to continue opposing the Maduro regime. Machado said she dedicated her award to Donald Trump and after the 2026 United States intervention in Venezuela she gave him her Nobel medal as a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom, according to...\n\n---\n\n## List of Ig Nobel Prize winners\nA parody of the Nobel Prizes, the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\". Commenting on the 2006 awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsor of the awards, said that \"[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology\". All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release.\n\n---\n\n## List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Nobel Peace Prize annually \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.\" As dictated by Alfred Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Norwegian Nobel Committee and awarded by a committee of five people elected by the Parliament of Norway.\nEach recipient receives a medal, a diploma, and a monetary award prize (that has varied throughout the years). It is one of the five prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, physiology or medicine."

Five members of the family in total were awarded a Nobel Prize, with Marie winning twice.\nMarie and Pierre shared a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and Marie was awarded a second one in chemistry in 1911, making her the first person in history to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific disciplines. To date, only Linus Pauling has followed her in winning prizes in multiple categories, in chemistry and peace. Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935. Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr., the spouse of Ir\u00e8ne's younger sister, \u00c8ve Curie, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965. \nThe chemical element curium (number 96) is named after Marie and Pierre.\nWhile Pierre Curie died at age 46 from an accident, M...\n\n---\n\n## Marie Curie\nMaria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska Curie (Polish: [\u02c8marja sal\u0254\u02c8m\u025ba skw\u0254\u02c8d\u0254fska k\u02b2i\u02c8ri] ; n\u00e9e Sk\u0142odowska; 7 November 1867 \u2013 4 July 1934), better known as Marie Curie ( KURE-ee; French: [ma\u0281i ky\u0281i] ), was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie \"for their joint researches on the  radioactivity phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel\". She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"[for] the discovery of the  elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\". \nShe was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. Marie and Pierre were the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.
