The term artificial photosynthesis is used loosely, referring to any scheme for capturing and then storing energy from sunlight by producing a fuel, specifically a solar fuel. An advantage of artificial photosynthesis would be that the solar energy could be converted and stored. By contrast, using photovoltaic cells, sunlight is converted into electricity and then converted again into chemical energy for storage, with some necessary losses of energy associated with the second conversion. The byproducts of these reactions are environmentally friendly. Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a carbon-neutral source of energy, but it has never been demonstrated in any practical sense. The economics of artificial photosynthesis are noncompetitive.\n\n---\n\n## Evolution of photosynthesis\nThe evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is used to assemble sugars from carbon dioxide and a hydrogen and electron source such as water. It is believed that the pigments used for photosynthesis initially were used for protection from the harmful effects of light, particularly ultraviolet light. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779.\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. A C3 plant uses the Calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate CO2 into organic material. A C4 ...\n\n---\n\n## Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis ( FOH-t\u0259-SINTH-\u0259-sis) is a system of biological processes by which photopigment-bearing autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy \u2014 typically from sunlight \u2014 into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. The term photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting. Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds (complex compounds containing carbon), typically carbohydrates like sugars (mainly glucose, fructose and sucrose), starches, phytoglycogen and cellulose. When needing to use this stored energy, an organism's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Ea..."

Artificially photosynthesized fuel would be a carbon-neutral source of energy, but it has never been demonstrated in any practical sense. The economics of artificial photosynthesis are noncompetitive.\n\n---\n\n## Evolution of photosynthesis\nThe evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is used to assemble sugars from carbon dioxide and a hydrogen and electron source such as water. It is believed that the pigments used for photosynthesis initially were used for protection from the harmful effects of light, particularly ultraviolet light. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779.\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. A C3 plant uses the Calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate CO2 into organic material. A C4 ...\n\n---\n\n## Photosynthesis\nPhotosynthesis ( FOH-t\u0259-SINTH-\u0259-sis) is a system of biological processes by which photopigment-bearing autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy \u2014 typically from sunlight \u2014 into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. The term photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting. Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds (complex compounds containing carbon), typically carbohydrates like sugars (mainly glucose, fructose and sucrose), starches, phytoglycogen and cellulose. When needing to use this stored energy, an organism's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Ea..."

This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, \"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\", which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning \"his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time\".\n\n---\n\n## Photoelectric effect\nThe photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material caused by electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light. Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons. The phenomenon is studied in condensed matter physics, solid state, and quantum chemistry to draw inferences about the properties of atoms, molecules and solids. The effect has found use in electronic devices specialized for light detection and precisely timed electron emission.\nThe experimental results disagree with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that continuous light waves transfer energy to electrons, which would then be emitted when they accumulate enough energy. An alteration in the intensity of light would theoretically change the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, with sufficiently dim light resulting in a delayed emission. The experimental results instead show that electrons are dislodged only when the light exceeds a certain frequency\u2014regardless of the light's intensity..."

He was the founder and the first head of the physics departments of the Case School of Applied Science and the University of Chicago.\n\n---\n\n## Nobel Prize in Physics\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics is an annual award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions to mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\nThe prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature.\nThe first Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to German physicist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen in recognition of the extraordinary services he rendered by the discovery of X-rays. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is widely regarded as the most prestigious award that a scientist can receive in physics. It is presented in Stockholm at ...\n\n---\n\n## Nobel Prize in Physics controversies\nSince the first award in 1901 year, conferment of the Nobel Prizes, including the Nobel Prize in Physics, has engendered criticism and controversies. After his death in 1896, the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel established that an annual prize be awarded for service to humanity in the fields of physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and peace. Similarly, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, first awarded in 1969 year, is awarded along with the Nobel Prizes.\nNobel sought to reward \"those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind\". One prize, he stated, should be given \"to the person who shall have made the most important 'discovery' or 'invention' within the field of physics\". Awards committees have historically rewarded discoveries over inventions: up to 2004 year, 77 percent of Nobel Prizes in Physics have been given to discoveries, compared with only 23 percent to inventions...."

Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called \"the world's most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for \"his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\".\nBorn in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD disserta...\n\n---\n\n## List of awards and honors received by Albert Einstein\nIn 1922 Albert Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics, \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". This refers to his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, \"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\", which was well supported by the experimental evidence by that time. The presentation speech began by mentioning \"his theory of relativity [which had] been the subject of lively debate in philosophical circles [and] also has astrophysical implications which are being rigorously examined at the present time\".\n\n---\n\n## Photoelectric effect\nThe photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a material caused by electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light. Electrons emitted in this manner are called photoelectrons. The phenomenon is studied in condensed matter physics, solid state, and quantum chemistry to draw inferences about the properties of atoms, molecules and solids. The effect has found use in electronic devices specialized for light detection and precisely timed electron emission.\nThe experimental results disagree with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that continuous light waves transfer energy to electrons, which would then be emitted when they accumulate enough energy. An alteration in the intensity of light would theoretically change the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, with sufficiently dim light resulting in a delayed emission. The experimental results instead show that electrons are dislodged only when the light exceeds a certain frequency\u2014regardless of the light's intensity..."

Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries.

After the extensive development of the railway network during the 1840s, rapid economic growth and modernization sparked the process of industrialization. Under Prussian leadership Germany was united in 1871 and its economy grew rapidly. The largest economy in Europe by 1900, Germany had established a primary position in several key sectors, like the chemical industry and steel production. High production capacity, permanent competitiveness and subsequent protectionist policies fought out with the US and Britain were essential characteristics.\nBy the end of World War II, the country's economic infrastructure was completely destroyed.

It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP.

When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion.

            "content": "## Economy of the United States\nThe United States has a highly developed diversified market-oriented economy. It is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). As of 2025, it has the world's ninth-highest nominal GDP per capita and eleventh-highest GDP per capita by PPP. According to the World Bank, the U.S. accounted for 14.8% of the global aggregate GDP in 2024 in purchasing power parity terms and 26.2% in nominal terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and the world's foremost reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Since the end of World War II, the economy has achieved relatively steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology, but now faces challenges such as a very high debt-to-GDP ratio at over 120% of GDP, slower economic growth, and a housing crisis.\nThe American economy is fuel...\n\n---\n\n## List of countries by GDP (nominal)\nGross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services from a nation in a given year. Countries are sorted by nominal GDP estimates from financial and statistical institutions, which are calculated at market or government official exchange rates. Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency. Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.\nComparisons of national wealth are also frequently made based on purchasing power parity (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita, are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita...\n\n---\n\n## List of countries by largest historical GDP\nThis list of countries by largest historical GDP shows how the membership and rankings of the world's ten largest economies as measured by their gross domestic product has changed. While the United States has consistently had the world's largest economy for some time, in the last fifty years the world has seen both rises and falls in relative terms of the economies of other countries."

            "content": "## Economic history of Germany\nUntil the early 19th century, Germany, a federation of numerous states of varying size and development, retained its pre-industrial character, where trade centered around a number of free cities. After the extensive development of the railway network during the 1840s, rapid economic growth and modernization sparked the process of industrialization. Under Prussian leadership Germany was united in 1871 and its economy grew rapidly. The largest economy in Europe by 1900, Germany had established a primary position in several key sectors, like the chemical industry and steel production. High production capacity, permanent competitiveness and subsequent protectionist policies fought out with the US and Britain were essential characteristics.\nBy the end of World War II, the country's economic infrastructure was completely destroyed. West Germany embarked in its program of reconstruction guided by the economic principles of the Minister of Economics Ludwig Erhard excelled in the economic mirac...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Germany\nGermany has a highly developed social market economy. It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but has ranked among the world's top four since 1960. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Germany accounted for 23.7% of the Eurozone economy in 2025, with which it has achieved a high degree of economic integration. With a population of around 83,000,000 people, Germany represents the largest consumer market in the European Union. It is a founding member of both the European Union and the Eurozone.\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally, with $1.66 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus of $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Nazi Germany\nLike many other nations at the time, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression, with unemployment soaring after the Wall Street crash of 1929. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they ..."
