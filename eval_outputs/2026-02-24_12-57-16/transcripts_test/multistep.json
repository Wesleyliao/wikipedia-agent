At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.

An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten.

It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.

The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.\nWhen considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point or crystallization point. Because of the ability of substances to supercool, the freezing point can easily appear to be below its actual value. When the \"characteristic freezing point\" of a substance is determined, in fact, the actual methodology is almost always \"the principle of observing the disappearance rather than the formation of ice, that is, the melting point.\"\n\n---\n\n## Tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are in the refractory metals group that maintain useful physical and chemical properties even at high temperatures. The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.  Some common variants are:\n\n(Ta \u2013 2.5% W): also called tantaloy 63 metal. The percentage of tungsten is about 2\u20133% and includes 0.5% of niobium.  This alloy has a good resistance to corrosion and performs well at high temperatures. An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten. The difference from this alloy to the others is that this alloy represents a high resilience modulus while maintaining its refractory pro...\n\n---\n\n## Tungsten\nTungsten (also called wolfram) is a chemical element which has the symbol W (from German: Wolfram) and atomic number 74. It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work into metal. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut wi..."

With an estimated diameter of 1,469 km (913 mi), it is the third-largest moon of Saturn and the eleventh-largest in the Solar System. Named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.\nA relatively low-density body composed mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its dark leading hemisphere and its bright trailing hemisphere, as well as a massive equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Saturn\nSaturn has 274 confirmed moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Saturn's moons are diverse in size, ranging from tiny moonlets to Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and the second largest moon in the Solar System. Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit). They include the seven rounded satellites, and four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with some of the large moons.

Rhea is the smallest body in the Solar System that is confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It has a nearly circular orbit around Saturn, but it is also tidally locked, like Saturn's other major moons. It rotates with the same period it revolves or orbitso. Thus, one hemisphere always faces towards the planet. \nThe moon has a fairly low density, composed of roughly three-quarters ice and only one-quarter rock. The surface of Rhea is heavily cratered, with distinct leading and trailing hemispheres. Like the moon Dione, it has high-albedo ice cliffs that appear as bright wispy streaks visible from space. The surface temperature varies between \u2212174 \u00b0C and \u2212220 \u00b0C.\nRhea was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Since then, it has been visited by both Voyager probes and was the subject of close targeted flybys by the Cass..."

With an estimated diameter of 1,469 km (913 mi), it is the third-largest moon of Saturn and the eleventh-largest in the Solar System. Named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.\nA relatively low-density body composed mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its dark leading hemisphere and its bright trailing hemisphere, as well as a massive equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Saturn\nSaturn has 274 confirmed moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Saturn's moons are diverse in size, ranging from tiny moonlets to Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and the second largest moon in the Solar System. Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit). They include the seven rounded satellites, and four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with some of the large moons.

Rhea is the smallest body in the Solar System that is confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It has a nearly circular orbit around Saturn, but it is also tidally locked, like Saturn's other major moons. It rotates with the same period it revolves or orbitso. Thus, one hemisphere always faces towards the planet. \nThe moon has a fairly low density, composed of roughly three-quarters ice and only one-quarter rock. The surface of Rhea is heavily cratered, with distinct leading and trailing hemispheres. Like the moon Dione, it has high-albedo ice cliffs that appear as bright wispy streaks visible from space. The surface temperature varies between \u2212174 \u00b0C and \u2212220 \u00b0C.\nRhea was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Since then, it has been visited by both Voyager probes and was the subject of close targeted flybys by the Cass..."

It corresponds roughly to the territory of modern Iraq. Just beyond it lies southwestern Iran, where the region transitions into the Persian plateau, marking the shift from the Arab world to Iran.\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history, including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture\". It is recognised as the cradle of some of the world's earliest civilizations.\nThe Sumerians and Akkadians, each originating from different areas, dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of recorded history (c.\u20093100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. The rise of empires, beginning with Sargon o...\n\n---\n\n## Tigris\nThe Tigris ( TY-griss; see below) is the eastern of the two great rivers that define Mesopotamia, the other being the Euphrates. The river flows south from the mountains of the Armenian Highlands through the Syrian and Arabian Deserts, before merging with the Euphrates and reaching to the Persian Gulf.\nThe Tigris passes through historical cities such as Mosul, Tikrit, Samarra and Baghdad. It is also home to archaeological sites and ancient religious communities, including the Mandaeans, who use it for baptism. In ancient times the Tigris nurtured the Assyrian Empire, with remnants such as the relief of King Tiglath-Pileser.\nToday the Tigris faces modern threats from geopolitical instability, dam projects, poor water management and climate change, leading to concerns about its sustainability. Efforts to protect and preserve the river's legacy are ongoing, with local archaeologists and activists working to safeguard its future.\n\n---\n\n## Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system\nThe Tigris\u2013Euphrates river system is a large river system in West Asia that flows into the Persian Gulf. Its primary rivers are the Tigris and Euphrates, along with smaller tributaries.\nFrom their sources and upper courses in the eastern Turkey, being Lake Hazar for the Tigris and Karasu along with the Murat River for the Euphrates, the two rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq. Other tributaries join the Tigris from sources in the Zagros Mountains to the east. The rivers flow in a south-easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al-Qurnah to form the Shatt al-Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf. The rivers and their tributaries drain an area of 879,790 square kilometres (339,690 sq mi), including almost the entire area of Iraq as well as portions of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Kuwait.\nThe region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civ..."

They were formulated by Leonhard Euler about 50 years after Isaac Newton formulated his laws.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Motion\nIn physics, motion is when an object changes its position with respect to a reference point in a given time. Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed, and frame of reference to an observer, measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with a change in time. The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to their cause is called kinematics, while the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is called dynamics.\nIf an object is not in motion relative to a given frame of reference, it is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have a constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings. Modern physics holds that, as there is no absolute frame of reference, Isaac Newton's concept of absolute motion cannot be determined. Everything in the universe can be considered to be in motion.\nMotion applies to various physical systems: objects, bodi...\n\n---\n\n## Newton's laws of motion\nNewton's laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nA body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.\nAt any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.\nIf two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\nThe three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally published in 1687. Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems. In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, b..."

They were formulated by Leonhard Euler about 50 years after Isaac Newton formulated his laws.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Motion\nIn physics, motion is when an object changes its position with respect to a reference point in a given time. Motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed, and frame of reference to an observer, measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame with a change in time. The branch of physics describing the motion of objects without reference to their cause is called kinematics, while the branch studying forces and their effect on motion is called dynamics.\nIf an object is not in motion relative to a given frame of reference, it is said to be at rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or to have a constant or time-invariant position with reference to its surroundings. Modern physics holds that, as there is no absolute frame of reference, Isaac Newton's concept of absolute motion cannot be determined. Everything in the universe can be considered to be in motion.\nMotion applies to various physical systems: objects, bodi...\n\n---\n\n## Newton's laws of motion\nNewton's laws of motion are three physical laws that describe the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws, which provide the basis for Newtonian mechanics, can be paraphrased as follows:\n\nA body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight line, unless it is acted upon by a force.\nAt any instant of time, the net force on a body is equal to the body's acceleration multiplied by its mass or, equivalently, the rate at which the body's momentum is changing with time.\nIf two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions.\nThe three laws of motion were first stated by Isaac Newton in his Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), originally published in 1687. Newton used them to investigate and explain the motion of many physical objects and systems. In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, b..."

It is currently undergoing renovation, and with a planned increased seating capacity of 105,000 it will retain its position as the largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in Spain and Europe, as well as the second largest association football stadium, while becoming the fifth largest overall stadium in the world.\nCamp Nou has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two European Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga finals, and twenty-one Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a finals.

Unlike the rest of the Iberian broad gauge network, the Spanish High-speed network mainly uses standard gauge. This permits direct connections to outside Spain through the link to the French network at the Perthus Tunnel. High-speed trains run on a network of high-speed rail track owned and managed by ADIF (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias), where the dominant service is AVE while other high speed services such as Avant, Alvia, Avlo, Euromed, Ouigo Espa\u00f1a and Iryo, as well as mid-speed (InterCity) services also operate.\nAVE trains are operated by Renfe, the national passenger high-speed rail operator in Spain, but other companies such as Ouigo Espa\u00f1a and Iryo compete on the Madrid\u2013Barcelona and other routes in accordance with the European Union legislation.

Although major polio epidemics were unknown before the 20th century, the disease has caused paralysis and death for much of human history. Over millennia, polio survived quietly as an endemic pathogen until the 1900s when major epidemics began to occur in Europe. Soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the rest of the world. By 1910, frequent epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over half a million people worldwide every year.\nThe fear and the collective response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization spurring the development of new methods to prevent and treat the disease and revolutionizing medical philanthropy.

He was born in New York City and attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine.\nIn 1947, Salk accepted a professorship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he undertook a project beginning in 1948 to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. For the next seven years, Salk devoted himself to developing a vaccine against polio.\nSalk was immediately hailed as a \"miracle worker\" when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it in order to maximize its global distribution. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the University of Pittsburgh looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, their patent attorney said, \"If there we...\n\n---\n\n## Polio vaccine\nPolio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio). Two types are used: an inactivated poliovirus given by injection (IPV) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018.\nThe inactivated polio vaccines are very safe. Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection. Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given. This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection. Both types of vaccine are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS, but are otherwise well.

The agent stimulates the immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing i..."

Although major polio epidemics were unknown before the 20th century, the disease has caused paralysis and death for much of human history. Over millennia, polio survived quietly as an endemic pathogen until the 1900s when major epidemics began to occur in Europe. Soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the rest of the world. By 1910, frequent epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over half a million people worldwide every year.\nThe fear and the collective response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization spurring the development of new methods to prevent and treat the disease and revolutionizing medical philanthropy. Although the development of two polio vaccines has eliminated wild poliomyelitis in all but two countries (Afghanista...\n\n---\n\n## Jonas Salk\nJonas Edward Salk (; born Jonas Salk; October 28, 1914 \u2013 June 23, 1995) was an American virologist and medical researcher who developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. He was born in New York City and attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine.\nIn 1947, Salk accepted a professorship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he undertook a project beginning in 1948 to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. For the next seven years, Salk devoted himself to developing a vaccine against polio.\nSalk was immediately hailed as a \"miracle worker\" when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it in order to maximize its global distribution. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the University of Pittsburgh looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, their patent attorney said, \"If there we...\n\n---\n\n## Polio vaccine\nPolio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio). Two types are used: an inactivated poliovirus given by injection (IPV) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018.\nThe inactivated polio vaccines are very safe. Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection. Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given. This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection. Both types of vaccine are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS, but are otherwise well. However, the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), a form of the vaccine virus that has reverted to caus..."

It is exhibited in the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid.\nThe grey, black, and white painting, on a canvas 3.49 meters (11 ft 5 in) tall and 7.76 meters (25 ft 6 in) across, portrays the suffering wrought by violence and chaos. Prominently featured in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.\nPicasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany's Condor Legion and Fascist Italy. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exposition and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting soon became wide..."

The limbs play a major part in the movement of the horse, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures that provide blood flow through the lower leg.

It was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at Hadar, a site in the Awash Valley of the Afar Triangle, by Donald Johanson, a paleoanthropologist of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.\nLucy is an early australopithecine and is dated to about 3.2 million years ago. The skeleton presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes, plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal and upright, akin to that of humans (and other hominins); this combination supports the view of human evolution that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size. A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was, at least partly, tree-dwelling, though the extent of this is debated.\nLucy was named by Pamela Alderman after the 1967 song \"Lucy in the Sky w...\n\n---\n\n## Skeleton\nA skeleton is the structural frame that supports the body of most animals. There are several types of skeletons, including the exoskeleton, which is a rigid outer shell that holds up an organism's shape; the endoskeleton, a rigid internal frame to which the organs and soft tissues attach; and the hydroskeleton, a flexible internal structure supported by the hydrostatic pressure of body fluids.\nVertebrates are animals with an endoskeleton centered around an axial vertebral column, and their skeletons are typically composed of bones and cartilages. Invertebrates are other animals that lack a vertebral column, and their skeletons vary, including hard-shelled exoskeleton (arthropods and most molluscs), plated internal shells (e.g. cuttlebones in some cephalopods) or rods (e.g. ossicles in echinoderms), hydrostatically supported body cavities (most), and spicules (sponges). Cartilage is a rigid connective tissue that is found in the skeletal systems of vertebrates and invertebrates."

They include three apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep, and the reciprocal apparatus, which causes the hock to follow the motions of the stifle. The limbs play a major part in the movement of the horse, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures that provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense m...\n\n---\n\n## Lucy (hominid)\nAL 288-1, commonly known as Lucy or Dink\u02bcinesh (Amharic: \u12f5\u1295\u1245 \u1290\u123d, lit.\u2009'you are marvellous'), is a collection of several hundred pieces of fossilized bone comprising 40 percent of the skeleton of a female of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. It was discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia, at Hadar, a site in the Awash Valley of the Afar Triangle, by Donald Johanson, a paleoanthropologist of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.\nLucy is an early australopithecine and is dated to about 3.2 million years ago. The skeleton presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes, plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal and upright, akin to that of humans (and other hominins); this combination supports the view of human evolution that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size. A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was, at least partly, tree-dwelling, though the extent of this is debated.\nLucy was named by Pamela Alderman after the 1967 song \"Lucy in the Sky w...\n\n---\n\n## Skeleton\nA skeleton is the structural frame that supports the body of most animals. There are several types of skeletons, including the exoskeleton, which is a rigid outer shell that holds up an organism's shape; the endoskeleton, a rigid internal frame to which the organs and soft tissues attach; and the hydroskeleton, a flexible internal structure supported by the hydrostatic pressure of body fluids.\nVertebrates are animals with an endoskeleton centered around an axial vertebral column, and their skeletons are typically composed of bones and cartilages. Invertebrates are other animals that lack a vertebral column, and their skeletons vary, including hard-shelled exoskeleton (arthropods and most molluscs), plated internal shells (e.g. cuttlebones in some cephalopods) or rods (e.g. ossicles in echinoderms), hydrostatically supported body cavities (most), and spicules (sponges). Cartilage is a rigid connective tissue that is found in the skeletal systems of vertebrates and invertebrates."

She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie \"for their joint researches on the  radioactivity phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel\". She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"[for] the discovery of the  elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\". \nShe was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. Marie and Pierre were the first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.

It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly-measured concentration is very low. The nitrogen, sulfur, and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary, and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet. From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.  Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients. The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes composed of layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water.

In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe. Like Jupiter's spot, the Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms. However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot. Little is known about the origins, movement, and disappearance of the dark spots observed on the planet since 1989.\n\n---\n\n## Great Red Spot\nThe Great Red Spot is a persistent, high-pressure region in the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter, producing the largest anticyclonic storm in the Solar System. It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph).

            "content": "## Atmosphere of Jupiter\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly-measured concentration is very low. The nitrogen, sulfur, and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.\nThe atmosphere of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary, and gradually transitions into the liquid interior of the planet. From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere and exosphere.  Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients. The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes composed of layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide, and water. The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are o...\n\n---\n\n## Great Dark Spot\nThe Great Dark Spot (also known as GDS-89, for Great Dark Spot, 1989) was one of a series of dark spots on Neptune similar in appearance to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. In 1989, GDS-89 was the first Great Dark Spot on Neptune to be observed by NASA's Voyager 2 space probe. Like Jupiter's spot, the Great Dark Spots are anticyclonic storms. However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot. Little is known about the origins, movement, and disappearance of the dark spots observed on the planet since 1989.\n\n---\n\n## Great Red Spot\nThe Great Red Spot is a persistent, high-pressure region in the atmosphere of the planet Jupiter, producing the largest anticyclonic storm in the Solar System. It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, owing to its red-orange color whose origin is still unknown. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). It was first observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began. A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; if this is the same storm, it has existed for at least 361 years, but a study from 2024 suggests this is not the case."
