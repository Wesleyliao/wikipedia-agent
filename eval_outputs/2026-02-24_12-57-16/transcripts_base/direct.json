Additionally, 372 Vatican citizens live abroad, primarily diplomats of the Holy See and cardinals in Rome. Vatican City remains the world's smallest country in both land area and population size.\nThe population of Vatican City includes clergy, religious members, lay employees of the state (like the Swiss Guard), and their families. In 2013, 13 families of Holy See employees lived in Vatican City, and by 2019, 20 children of Swiss Guards resided there. All citizens, residents, and places of worship are Catholic. The city also hosts thousands of tourists and daily workers.\n\n---\n\n## Geography of Vatican City\nThe Vatican City is unique due to the country's position as an urban, landlocked enclave of Rome, Italy. With an area of 49 hectares (120 acres; 0.49 square kilometres), and a border with Italy of 3.5 km (2.2 mi), it is the world's smallest independent state. Outside the Vatican City, thirteen buildings in Rome and Castel Gandolfo (the pope's summer residence) enjoy extraterritorial rights (one building, the Paul VI Audience Hall, straddles the border, but its Italian portion has extraterritorial rights). The country contains no major natural resources, and no known natural hazards other than those that affect Rome in general, such as earthquakes.\n\n---\n\n## Vatican City\nVatican City, officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), often shortened as the Vatican, is a landlocked sovereign city-state. Ruled by the pope, it is an enclave within the city of Rome, Italy, and serves as the administrative centre of the Catholic Church. Vatican City is governed by the See of Rome, commonly known as the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains its temporal power, governance, diplomacy, and spiritual independence. Vatican is also used as a metonym for the Holy See, which is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, comprising the pope and the Roman Curia. The independent state of Vatican City came into existence in 1929 via the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, which spoke of it as a creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756\u20131870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\nW..."

            "content": "## Demographics of Vatican City\nVatican City had an estimated resident population of 882 in 2024, including non-citizens. Additionally, 372 Vatican citizens live abroad, primarily diplomats of the Holy See and cardinals in Rome. Vatican City remains the world's smallest country in both land area and population size.\nThe population of Vatican City includes clergy, religious members, lay employees of the state (like the Swiss Guard), and their families. In 2013, 13 families of Holy See employees lived in Vatican City, and by 2019, 20 children of Swiss Guards resided there. All citizens, residents, and places of worship are Catholic. The city also hosts thousands of tourists and daily workers.\n\n---\n\n## Geography of Vatican City\nThe Vatican City is unique due to the country's position as an urban, landlocked enclave of Rome, Italy. With an area of 49 hectares (120 acres; 0.49 square kilometres), and a border with Italy of 3.5 km (2.2 mi), it is the world's smallest independent state. Outside the Vatican City, thirteen buildings in Rome and Castel Gandolfo (the pope's summer residence) enjoy extraterritorial rights (one building, the Paul VI Audience Hall, straddles the border, but its Italian portion has extraterritorial rights). The country contains no major natural resources, and no known natural hazards other than those that affect Rome in general, such as earthquakes.\n\n---\n\n## Vatican City\nVatican City, officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano; Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae), often shortened as the Vatican, is a landlocked sovereign city-state. Ruled by the pope, it is an enclave within the city of Rome, Italy, and serves as the administrative centre of the Catholic Church. Vatican City is governed by the See of Rome, commonly known as the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains its temporal power, governance, diplomacy, and spiritual independence. Vatican is also used as a metonym for the Holy See, which is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, comprising the pope and the Roman Curia. The independent state of Vatican City came into existence in 1929 via the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, which spoke of it as a creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756\u20131870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\nW..."
