      "explanation": "The response correctly identifies Canberra as Australia's capital and provides accurate context about its location and founding. The tone is professional and well-structured, though the additional historical detail about the 1901 compromise, while accurate and interesting, slightly exceeds what was asked for a straightforward factual question."
