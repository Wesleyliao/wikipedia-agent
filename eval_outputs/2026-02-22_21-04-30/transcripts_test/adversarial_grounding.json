At 7,088 km  long, it is the longest river in the world, although the volume of water it carries is much smaller than other major rivers such as the Amazon or Congo.   The Nile has played a central role in the environmental, economic, and cultural history of Africa for millennia.  The river's drainage basin covers portions of eleven countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is longer and is considered to be the headwaters, although the Blue Nile contributes over two thirds of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan; and the Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.

It is one of the world's largest deltas. From Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east; it covers 240 km (150 mi) of the Mediterranean coastline and is a rich agricultural region.

The name \"White\" comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.\nIn the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, \"White Nile\" refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the \"Albert Nile\" to the South Sudan border, and then the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Bahr-al-Jabal\" down to Lake No. \"White Nile\" may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being 3,700 km (2,300 mi) from the Blue Nile."

At 7,088 km  long, it is the longest river in the world, although the volume of water it carries is much smaller than other major rivers such as the Amazon or Congo.   The Nile has played a central role in the environmental, economic, and cultural history of Africa for millennia.  The river's drainage basin covers portions of eleven countries: Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.\nThe Nile has two major tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is longer and is considered to be the headwaters, although the Blue Nile contributes over two thirds of the water and silt below the confluence of the two. The White Nile begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan; and the Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The ...\n\n---\n\n## Nile Delta\nThe Nile Delta (Arabic: \u062f\u0644\u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644, Delta an-N\u012bl or simply \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u062a\u0627, ad-Delta) is the delta formed in Lower Egypt where the Nile River spreads out and drains into the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the world's largest deltas. From Alexandria in the west to Port Said in the east; it covers 240 km (150 mi) of the Mediterranean coastline and is a rich agricultural region. From north to south the delta is approximately 160 km (100 mi) in length. The Delta begins from Cairo.\n\n---\n\n## White Nile\nThe White Nile (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u064a\u0636 an-n\u012bl al-'abya\u1e0d) is a river in North and East Africa, the minor of the two main tributaries of the Nile, the larger being the Blue Nile. The name \"White\" comes from the clay sediment carried in the water that changes the water to a pale color.\nIn the strict meaning, \"White Nile\" refers to the river formed at Lake No, at the confluence of the Bahr al Jabal and Bahr el Ghazal Rivers. In the wider sense, \"White Nile\" refers to all the stretches of river draining from Lake Victoria through to the merger with the Blue Nile: the \"Victoria Nile\" from Lake Victoria via Lake Kyoga to Lake Albert, then the \"Albert Nile\" to the South Sudan border, and then the \"Mountain Nile\" or \"Bahr-al-Jabal\" down to Lake No. \"White Nile\" may sometimes include the headwaters of Lake Victoria, the most remote of which being 3,700 km (2,300 mi) from the Blue Nile."

A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi) from Jiayu Pass in the west to the sea in Shanhai Pass, then looping over to terminate in Manchuria at the Hushan Great Wall. This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.\nWhile the Ming walls are generally referred to as \"Great Wall\" (changcheng)  in modern times, in Ming times they were called \"border barriers\" (\u908a\u7246; bianqiang) by the Chinese, since the term changcheng was said to evoke imagery of the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang (260\u2013210 BC) and was associated with the Qin Great Wall."

A comprehensive archaeological survey, using advanced technologies, has concluded that the Ming walls measure 8,850 km (5,500 mi) from Jiayu Pass in the west to the sea in Shanhai Pass, then looping over to terminate in Manchuria at the Hushan Great Wall. This is made up of 6,259 km (3,889 mi) sections of actual wall, 359 km (223 mi) of trenches and 2,232 km (1,387 mi) of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers.\nWhile the Ming walls are generally referred to as \"Great Wall\" (changcheng)  in modern times, in Ming times they were called \"border barriers\" (\u908a\u7246; bianqiang) by the Chinese, since the term changcheng was said to evoke imagery of the tyranny of Qin Shi Huang (260\u2013210 BC) and was associated with the Qin Great Wall."

With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.\nThe name \"Sahara\" is derived from Arabic: \u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0649, romanized: \u1e63a\u1e25\u0101r\u0101 /s\u02e4a\u0127a\u02d0ra\u02d0/, a broken plural form of \u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101' (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0621 /s\u02e4a\u0127ra\u02d0\u0294/), meaning \"desert\".\nThe desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.\nIt stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan region of sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the...\n\n---\n\n## Sahara Desert (ecoregion)\nThe Sahara Desert, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), includes the hyper-arid center of the Sahara, between latitudes 18\u00b0 N and 30\u00b0 N. It is one of several desert and xeric shrubland ecoregions that cover the northern portion of the African continent.\n\n"

They were the second married couple, after her parents, to win the Nobel Prize, adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date.\nHer mother Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie and she also form the only mother\u2013daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes whilst Pierre and Ir\u00e8ne Curie form the only father-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes by the same occasion, whilst six father-son pairs have won Nobel Prizes by comparison.\nShe was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research under the Popular Front in 1936. Both children of the Joliot-Curies, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Pierre, are also scientists.\nIn 1945,...\n\n---\n\n## Marie Curie\nMaria Salomea Sk\u0142odowska Curie (Polish: [\u02c8marja sal\u0254\u02c8m\u025ba skw\u0254\u02c8d\u0254fska k\u02b2i\u02c8ri] ; n\u00e9e Sk\u0142odowska; 7 November 1867 \u2013 4 July 1934), better known as Marie Curie ( KURE-ee; French: [ma\u0281i ky\u0281i] ), was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist. She shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with her husband Pierre Curie \"for their joint researches on the  radioactivity phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel\". She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \"[for] the discovery of the  elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element\". \nShe was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields. Marie and Pierre were first married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris....\n\n---\n\n## Pierre Curie\nPierre Curie (15 May 1859 \u2013 19 April 1906) was a French physicist and chemist, and a pioneer in crystallography and magnetism. He shared one half of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with his wife, Marie Curie, for their work on radioactivity. With their win, the Curies became the first married couple to win a Nobel Prize, launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.\n\n"
