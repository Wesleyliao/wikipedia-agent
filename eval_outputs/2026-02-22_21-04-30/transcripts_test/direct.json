For example, a language is often defined as a set of mutually intelligible varieties, but independent national standard languages may be considered separate languages even though they are largely mutually intelligible, as in the case of Danish and Norwegian. Conversely, many commonly accepted languages, including German, Italian, and English, encompass varieties that are not mutually intelligible.

The film, which was set against the backdrop of the Woodstock festival of 1969 and the United States's first Moon landing of that year, was distributed by Miramax Films. Directed by Tony Goldwyn in his directorial debut, the film was acclaimed on release. Diane Lane earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead for her performance.\n\n---\n\n## Apollo 11\nApollo 11 (July 16\u201324, 1969) was the fifth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at 02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). The Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the command mod...\n\n---\n\n## List of Apollo astronauts\nAs part of the Apollo program by NASA, 24 astronauts flew nine missions to the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972. During six successful two-man landing missions, twelve men walked on the lunar surface, six of whom drove Lunar Roving Vehicles as part of the last three missions. Three men have been to the Moon twice, one orbited once and took a circumlunar trajectory the second time, while the other two landed once apiece. Apart from these 24 men, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. As of February 2026, five of the 24 remain alive. A number of non-human animals have circled or orbited it, including two tortoises, several turtles, and five mice.  \nApollo missions 8 and 10\u201317 were the nine crewed missions to the Moon. Apollo 4\u20136 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight.

The film, which was set against the backdrop of the Woodstock festival of 1969 and the United States's first Moon landing of that year, was distributed by Miramax Films. Directed by Tony Goldwyn in his directorial debut, the film was acclaimed on release. Diane Lane earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Female Lead for her performance.\n\n---\n\n## Apollo 11\nApollo 11 (July 16\u201324, 1969) was the fifth manned flight in the United States Apollo program and the first spaceflight to land humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin landed the Lunar Module Eagle on July 20 at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the surface about six hours later, at 02:56 UTC on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes afterward, and together they spent about two and a half hours exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. They collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material before re-entering the Lunar Module. In total, they were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before returning to the Command Module Columbia, which remained in lunar orbit, piloted by Michael Collins.\nApollo 11 was launched by a Saturn V rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on July 16 at 13:32 UTC (9:32 am EDT, local time). The Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the command mod...\n\n---\n\n## List of Apollo astronauts\nAs part of the Apollo program by NASA, 24 astronauts flew nine missions to the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972. During six successful two-man landing missions, twelve men walked on the lunar surface, six of whom drove Lunar Roving Vehicles as part of the last three missions. Three men have been to the Moon twice, one orbited once and took a circumlunar trajectory the second time, while the other two landed once apiece. Apart from these 24 men, no human being has gone beyond low Earth orbit. As of February 2026, five of the 24 remain alive. A number of non-human animals have circled or orbited it, including two tortoises, several turtles, and five mice.  \nApollo missions 8 and 10\u201317 were the nine crewed missions to the Moon. Apollo 4\u20136 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight. The Apollo program included three other crewed missions: Apollo 1 (AS-204) did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire, while Apollo 7 and Apol..."

It occupies much of far West Texas, the middle to lower Rio Grande Valley and the lower Pecos Valley in New Mexico, and a portion of southeastern Arizona, as well as the central and northern portions of the Mexican Plateau. It is bordered on the west by the Sonoran Desert, the Colorado Plateau, and the extensive Sierra Madre Occidental range, along with northwestern lowlands of the Sierra Madre Oriental range. Its largest, continual expanse is located in Mexico, covering a large portion of the state of Chihuahua, along with portions of Coahuila, north-eastern Durango, the extreme northern part of Zacatecas, and small western portions of Nuevo Le\u00f3n. With an area of about 501,896 km2 (193,783 sq mi), it is the largest hot desert in North America. The desert is fairly young, existing for only 8,000 years.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Gobi Desert\nThe Gobi Desert is a large, cold desert and grassland region in southern Mongolia and North China. It is the sixth-largest desert in the world. \nThe name of the desert comes from the Mongolian word gobi, used to refer to all of the waterless regions in the Mongolian Plateau; in Chinese, gobi is used to refer to rocky, semi-deserts such as the Gobi itself rather than sandy deserts.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Taklamakan Desert\nThe Taklamakan Desert ( TAK-l\u0259-m\u0259-KAN) is a desert in northwest China. Located inside the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, it is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Pamir Mountains to the west, the Tian Shan range to the north, and the Gobi Desert to the east."

Situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean (also known as the Antarctic Ocean), it contains the geographic South Pole. Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000 km2 (5,500,000 sq mi). Most of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, with an average thickness of 1.9 km (1.2 mi).\nAntarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the continents, and has the highest average elevation. It is mainly a polar desert, with annual precipitation of over 200 mm (8 in) along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's freshwater reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global sea levels by almost 60 metres (200 ft). Antarctica holds the record for the lowest measured temperature on Earth, \u221289.2 \u00b0C (\u2212128.6 \u00b0F). The coastal regions can reach temperatures over ...\n\n---\n\n## Patagonian Desert\nThe Patagonian Desert, also known as the Patagonian Steppe, is the largest desert in Argentina and is the eighth-largest desert in the world by area, occupying approx. 673,000 square kilometres (260,000 mi2). It is located primarily in Argentina and is bounded by the Andes, to its west, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east, in the region of Patagonia, southern Argentina and areas of Chile. To the north the desert grades into the Cuyo Region and the Monte. The central parts of the steppe are dominated by shrubby and herbaceous plant species albeit to the west, where precipitation is higher, bushes are replaced by grasses. Topographically the deserts consist of alternating tablelands and massifs dissected by river valleys and canyons. The more western parts of the steppe host lakes of glacial origin and grades into barren mountains or cold temperate forests along valleys.\nInhabited by hunter-gatherers since Pre-Hispanic times, the desert faced migration in the 19th century of Argentines, W...\n\n---\n\n## Sahara\nThe Sahara (, ) is a desert spanning across North Africa.
