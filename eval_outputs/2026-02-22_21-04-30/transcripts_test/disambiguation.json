Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state, stretching from Sumatra in Asia to the western part of New Guinea in Oceania.\n\n---\n\n## State of East Java\nThe State of East Java (Indonesian: Negara Jawa Timur) was a federal state (negara bagian) formed on the Indonesian island of Java by the Netherlands in 1948. It subsequently became a component of the United States of Indonesia, but merged into the Republic of Indonesia on 9 March 1950."

It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaini...\n\n---\n\n## Outline of the Java programming language\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Java:\nJava is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented, class-based, strong, and statically typed programming language that is compiled to Java bytecode for execution on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), where you can write once and run anywhere. Java was designed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and was a core component of Sun's Java platform.\n\n"

It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including astronomy, epistemology, mathematics, political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric and aesthetics. Greek philosophy continued throughout the Hellenistic period and later evolved into Roman philosophy.\nGreek philosophy has influenced much of Western culture since its inception, and can be found in many aspects of public education. Alfred North Whitehead once claimed: \"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato\".
