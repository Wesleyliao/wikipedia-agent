      "explanation": "The agent provided a comprehensive and well-structured response about Python the programming language with professional tone, but completely failed to acknowledge the ambiguity flagged in the context\u2014it did not mention or address that 'Python' could refer to the snake species, making it a missed opportunity for proper disambiguation handling."

      },
      "explanation": "The response excellently acknowledges ambiguity by listing multiple interpretations and directly asking for clarification, with professional and neutral tone. However, it is slightly verbose by providing four separate options and additional explanation when two or three key interpretations would have sufficed."

      "explanation": "The response fails to acknowledge the ambiguity noted in the context (Saturn as planet, Roman god, or car brand), instead assuming the planetary interpretation without any clarification.

      "explanation": "The response fails to acknowledge the ambiguity between the ancient Battle of Marathon and the modern running race, providing only the latter interpretation without noting alternatives.
