The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lamps is 50\u2013100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of general lighting incandescent bulbs with comparable light output, which is on the close order of 16 lm/W.\nFluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because, among other things, they require a ballast to regulate current through the lamp, but the initial cost is offset by a much lower running cost.

For bulbs powered by AC current, the thread is generally connected to neutral and the contact on the bottom tip of the base is connected to the \"live\" phase.\nIn North America and continental Europe, Edison screws displaced other socket types for general lighting. In the early days of electrification, Edison screws were the only standard connector, and appliances other than light bulbs were connected to AC power via lamp sockets. Today Edison screw sockets comply with international standards.\nTheir types are designated as \"Exx\", such as \"E26\", where \"xx\" indicates the diameter of the socket in millimeters.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Fluorescent lamp\nA fluorescent lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor, to produce ultraviolet and make a phosphor coating in the lamp glow. Fluorescent lamps convert electrical energy into visible light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps, but are less efficient than most LED lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lamps is 50\u2013100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of general lighting incandescent bulbs with comparable light output, which is on the close order of 16 lm/W.\nFluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because, among other things, they require a ballast to regulate current through the lamp, but the initial cost is offset by a much lower running cost. Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) made in the same sizes as incandescent lamp bulbs are used as an energy-saving alternative to incandescent lamps in hom...\n\n---\n\n## Incandescent light bulb\nAn incandescent light bulb, also known as an incandescent lamp or incandescent light globe, is an electric light that produces illumination by Joule heating a filament until it glows. The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\nIncandescent bulbs are much less ..."

It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere and the fourth most prominent peak on Earth.\nKilimanjaro's southern and eastern slopes served as the home of the Chagga Kingdoms until their abolition in 1963 by Julius Nyerere. The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is unknown, but may mean \"mountain of greatness\" or \"unclimbable\". Although described in classical sources, German missionary Johannes Rebmann is credited as the first European to report the mountain's existence, in 1848. After several European attempts, Hans Meyer reached Kilimanjaro's highest summit in 1889.\nThe mountain was incorporated into Kilimanjaro National Park in 1973.

It covers an area of 1,688 square kilometres (652 mi2), 2\u00b050'\u20133\u00b010'S 37\u00b010'\u201337\u00b040'E. The park is administered by the Tanzania National Parks Authority (TANAPA). It was established as a national park in 1973. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987 and one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa in 2013.\nThe Park Headquarters is at Marangu, about 44 Km from Moshi town and 86km from Kilimanjaro International Airport\nThe park generated US$51 million in revenue in 2013, the second-most of any Tanzanian national park, and was one of only two Tanzanian national parks to generate a surplus during the 2012\u20132013 budget ...\n\n---\n\n## Kilimanjaro Region\nKilimanjaro Region (Mkoa wa Kilimanjaro in Swahili) is one of Tanzania's 31 administrative regions. The regional capital and largest city is the municipality of Moshi. With the 3rd highest HDI of 0.640 in the country, Kilimanjaro is one among the top five most developed regions of Tanzania. According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 1,640,087, which was lower than the pre-census projection of 1,702,207. For 2002\u20132012, the region's 1.8 percent average annual population growth rate was the 24th highest in the country. It was also the eighth most densely populated region with 124 people per square kilometer. The most well-known tribes in the Kilimanjaro region are the Chaga.\nThe region forms part of the Northern Tourism Circuit in Tanzania. It is home to the Kilimanjaro National Park (which contains Mount Kilimanjaro), the Mkomazi National Park, the Pare Mountains, Lake Jipe, and Lake Chala. The region is bordered to the north and east by Kenya, to the south by ...\n\n---\n\n## Mount Kilimanjaro\nMount Kilimanjaro () is a large dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest free-standing mountain above sea level in the world, at 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere and the fourth most prominent peak on Earth.\nKilimanjaro's southern and eastern slopes served as the home of the Chagga Kingdoms until their abolition in 1963 by Julius Nyerere. The origin and meaning of the name Kilimanjaro is unknown, but may mean \"mountain of greatness\" or \"unclimbable\". Although described in classical sources, German missionary Johannes Rebmann is credited as the first European to report the mountain's existence, in 1848. After several European attempts, Hans Meyer reached Kilimanjaro's highest summit in 1889.\nThe mountain was incorporated into Kilimanjaro National Park in 1973. As one of the Seven Summits, Kilimanjaro is a major hiking and climbing destinatio..."
