It was intended to be a core component of Sun's Java platform with the principle of \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA)\u2014meaning compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without needing to be recompiled.\n\n**Language Design:**\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with syntax similar to C and C++, but with fewer low-level facilities. Unlike traditional compiled languages, Java applications are compiled to bytecode that runs on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.\n\n**Evolution and Development:**\nSince JDK 1.0, Java has undergone significant changes. Starting with J2SE 1.4, the evolution of Java has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes. The Java Class Library has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5.\n\n**Performance Improvements:**\nOriginally considered slower than C and C++, Java's performance improved significantly from the late 1990s onward through the introduction of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in 1997 and optimizations like HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000.\n\n**Modern Era:**\nIn September 2017, Java shifted to a \"one feature release every six months\" schedule instead of the previous two-year cycle. Java remains widely popular and was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.\n\n**Sources:** Wikipedia articles on Java (programming language), James Gosling, and Java version history.",

Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.\nMany of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally.

Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017, Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release train to \"one feature release every six months\" rather than the then-current two-year schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the current release schedule.\nIn addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5.

Early JVM implementations were interpreters; they simulated the virtual operations one-by-one rather than translating them into machine code for direct hardware execution.\nSince the late 1990s, the execution speed of Java programs improved significantly via introduction of just-in-time compilation (JIT) (in 1997 for Java 1.1), the addition of language features supporting better code analysis, and optimizations in the JVM (such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000).

It was a typeless language, with the only data type being the underlying machine's natural memory word format, whatever that might be. Depending on the context, the word was treated either as an integer or a memory address.\nAs machines with ASCII processing became common, notably the DEC PDP-11 that arrived at Bell Labs, support for character data stuffed in memory words became important. The typeless nature of the language was seen as a disadvantage, which led Thompson and Ritchie to develop an expanded version of the language supporting new internal and user-defined types, which became the ubiquitous C programming language.\n\n---\n\n## Functional programming\nIn computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class entities, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, i...\n\n---\n\n## James Gosling\nJames Arthur Gosling  (born 19 May 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.\nGosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to windowing systems."

It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically, and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobud...\n\n---\n\n## Java version history\nThe Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901. In September 2017, Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform, proposed to change the release train to \"one feature release every six months\" rather than the then-current two-year schedule. This proposal took effect for all following versions, and is still the current release schedule.\nIn addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and..."

Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then.

In contrast to those languages, Java compiles by default to a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) with operations distinct from those of the actual computer hardware. Early JVM implementations were interpreters; they simulated the virtual operations one-by-one rather than translating them into machine code for direct hardware execution.\nSince the late 1990s, the execution speed of Java programs improved significantly via introduction of just-in-time compilation (JIT) (in 1997 for Java 1.1), the addition of language features supporting better code analysis, and optimizations in the JVM (such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000). Sophisticated garbage collection strategies were also an area of improvement.

It was a typeless language, with the only data type being the underlying machine's natural memory word format, whatever that might be. Depending on the context, the word was treated either as an integer or a memory address.\nAs machines with ASCII processing became common, notably the DEC PDP-11 that arrived at Bell Labs, support for character data stuffed in memory words became important. The typeless nature of the language was seen as a disadvantage, which led Thompson and Ritchie to develop an expanded version of the language supporting new internal and user-defined types, which became the ubiquitous C programming language.\n\n---\n\n## Functional programming\nIn computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.\nIn functional programming, functions are treated as first-class entities, meaning that they can be bound to names (including local identifiers), passed as arguments, and returned from other functions, just as any other data type can. This allows programs to be written in a declarative and composable style, where small functions are combined in a modular manner.\nFunctional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, i...\n\n---\n\n## James Gosling\nJames Arthur Gosling  (born 19 May 1955) is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.\nGosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to windowing systems."

In this context, one essence/nature defines what God is, while the three persons define who God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes \"from the Father\", \"through the Son\", and \"in the Holy Spirit\".\nThis doctrine is called Trinitarianism, and its ad...\n\n---\n\n## Trinity (disambiguation)\nThe Trinity is the Christian doctrine of one God in three persons.\nTrinity may also refer to Trinity (nuclear test), a nuclear weapon test in New Mexico, United States.

In this context, one essence/nature defines what God is, while the three persons define who God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes \"from the Father\", \"through the Son\", and \"in the Holy Spirit\".\nThis doctrine is called Trinitarianism, and its ad...\n\n---\n\n## Trinity (disambiguation)\nThe Trinity is the Christian doctrine of one God in three persons.\nTrinity may also refer to Trinity (nuclear test), a nuclear weapon test in New Mexico, United States. Other uses include:\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Trinity College Dublin\nThe College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin, branded by the board as Trinity College, the University of Dublin, and officially incorporated as Trinity College Dublin (TCD) (Irish: Col\u00e1iste na Tr\u00edon\u00f3ide, Baile \u00c1tha Cliath), is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin in the Republic of Ireland. Founded in 1592 through a royal charter issued by Queen Elizabeth I, it is one of the extant seven ancient universities of Great Britain and Ireland. As Ireland's oldest university in continuous operation, Trinity contributed to Irish literature during the Victorian and Georgian eras and played a notable role in the recognition of Dublin as a UNESCO City of Literature.\nTrinity was established to consolidate the rule of the Tudor monarchy in Ireland, with Provost Adam Loftus christening it after Trinity College, Cambridge. Built on the site of the former Priory of All Hallows demolished by King Henry VIII, it was the Protestant university of the Asc..."

They observe the shadows projected onto the outer wall by objects carried behind the inner wall by people who are invisible to the chained \u201cprisoners\u201d and who walk along the inner wall with a fire behind them, creating the shadows on the inner wall in front of the prisoners.
