Particularly during the period from AD 395 to 476, there were separate, coequal courts dividing the governance of the empire into western and eastern provinces with a distinct imperial succession in the separate courts. The terms Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined in modern times to describe political entities that were de facto independent; contemporary Romans did not consider the Empire to have been split into two empires but viewed it as a single polity governed by two imperial courts for administrative purposes. The Western Empire collapsed in 476, and the Western imperial court in Ravenna disappeared by 554, at the end of Justinian's Gothic War. \nThough there were periods with more than one emperor ruling jointly before, the v..."

It was the dominant power in the Mediterranean and much of Europe for nearly five centuries, as documented in the Wikipedia articles on the *History of the Roman Empire* and *Ancient Rome*.\\n\\n## Early Origins and the Republic\\n\\n- **Founding**: Rome began as a settlement on the Italian Peninsula traditionally dated to **753 BC**, though archaeological evidence suggests it developed gradually from hilltop villages during the Bronze/Iron Age.\\n- **Early Expansion**: After the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC, Rome began expanding and eventually controlled the entire Italian Peninsula.\\n- **Mediterranean Domination**: During the **3rd century BC Punic Wars**, Rome expanded beyond Italy across the Mediterranean, becoming the dominant Mediterranean power.\\n\\n## Transition to Empire\\n\\n- **Civil Wars (1st Century BC)**: The Republic experienced devastating civil wars, first between Julius Caesar and Pompey, then between Octavian (Caesar\\'s grand-nephew) and Mark Antony.\\n- **Battle of Actium (31 BC)**: Octavian defeated Mark Antony, leading to the annexation of Egypt and establishing his dominance.\\n- **Octavian as Augustus (27 BC)**: The Senate granted Octavian the titles of Augustus (\"venerated\"), marking the traditional beginning of the Roman Empire.\\n\\n## Peak and Extent\\n\\nAt its height, the Roman Empire controlled:\\n- North Africa\\n- Egypt\\n- Southern Europe\\n- Most of Western Europe\\n- The Balkans, Crimea, and much of the Middle East\\n\\n## Fall of the Western Empire\\n\\nThe Western Roman Empire **collapsed in AD 476** with the abdication of Romulus Augustulus. Modern historians attribute this to multiple factors including:\\n- Declining military effectiveness\\n- Population decline\\n- Economic weakness\\n- Incompetent leadership\\n- Internal power struggles\\n- Invasion pressures from outside peoples\\n- Climatic changes and disease\\n\\n## The Eastern Empire\\n\\nThe Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) continued until the **fall of Constantinople in 1453**, roughly 1,000 years after the Western Empire\\'s collapse.\\n\\n**Sources cited**: Wikipedia articles on *History of the Roman Empire*, *Ancient Rome*, *Founding of Rome*, and *Fall of the Western Roman Empire*.', type='text')"

Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The mosquitoes themselves are harmed by malaria, causing reduced lifespans in those infected by it.\nMalaria is caused by single-celled eukaryotes of the genus Plasmodium. In mammals, it is spread through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into the blood.

The first approved vaccine for malaria is RTS,S, known by the brand name Mosquirix. As of April 2023, the vaccine has been given to 1.5 million children living in areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission. It requires at least three doses in infants by age 2, and a fourth dose extends the protection for another 1\u20132 years. The vaccine reduces hospital admissions from severe malaria by around 30%.\nResearch continues with other malaria vaccines. The most effective malaria vaccine is the R21/Matrix-M, with a 77% efficacy rate shown in initial trials and significantly higher antibody levels than with the RTS,S vaccine. It is the first vaccine that meets the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a malaria vaccine with at least 75% efficacy, and only the second m...\n\n---\n\n## Signs and symptoms\nSigns and symptoms are diagnostic indications of an illness, injury, or condition. While signs are objective and externally observable, symptoms are a person's reported subjective experiences.\nA sign, for example, can be an elevated or lower than normal temperature or blood pressure; or an abnormal finding showing on medical imaging. A symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache or other pains in the body. Symptoms can be a result of the immune system's response to an infection, the physical manifestation of an abnormal body condition, or the effect of a consumed substance. Symptoms, though often indicative of a disease process, are not always diagnostically relevant, and can be idiopathic in nature."

            "content": "## Malaria\nMalaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease which is transmitted by the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes. Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The mosquitoes themselves are harmed by malaria, causing reduced lifespans in those infected by it.\nMalaria is caused by single-celled eukaryotes of the genus Plasmodium. In mammals, it is spread through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into the blood. The parasites initiall...\n\n---\n\n## Malaria vaccine\nA Malaria vaccine is a vaccine that prevents malaria, a mosquito-borne infectious disease which affected an estimated 249 million people globally in 85 malaria-endemic countries and areas and caused 608,000 deaths in 2022. The first approved vaccine for malaria is RTS,S, known by the brand name Mosquirix. As of April 2023, the vaccine has been given to 1.5 million children living in areas with moderate-to-high malaria transmission. It requires at least three doses in infants by age 2, and a fourth dose extends the protection for another 1\u20132 years. The vaccine reduces hospital admissions from severe malaria by around 30%.\nResearch continues with other malaria vaccines. The most effective malaria vaccine is the R21/Matrix-M, with a 77% efficacy rate shown in initial trials and significantly higher antibody levels than with the RTS,S vaccine. It is the first vaccine that meets the World Health Organization's (WHO) goal of a malaria vaccine with at least 75% efficacy, and only the second m...\n\n---\n\n## Signs and symptoms\nSigns and symptoms are diagnostic indications of an illness, injury, or condition. While signs are objective and externally observable, symptoms are a person's reported subjective experiences.\nA sign, for example, can be an elevated or lower than normal temperature or blood pressure; or an abnormal finding showing on medical imaging. A symptom is something out of the ordinary that is experienced by an individual such as feeling feverish, a headache or other pains in the body. Symptoms can be a result of the immune system's response to an infection, the physical manifestation of an abnormal body condition, or the effect of a consumed substance. Symptoms, though often indicative of a disease process, are not always diagnostically relevant, and can be idiopathic in nature."

This was a major mass extinction that wiped out three-quarters of all plant and animal species on Earth.\n\n### The Asteroid Impact\n\nThe primary cause was a massive **asteroid impact**. An asteroid roughly **10 kilometers (6 miles) in diameter** struck Earth, creating the **Chicxulub crater** buried beneath the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. The crater is approximately 200 kilometers (120 miles) in diameter, making it one of the largest impact structures on Earth.\n\n### The Mechanism of Extinction\n\nThe asteroid impact likely caused extinction through an **\"impact winter\"** scenario. The collision would have:\n- Ejected enormous amounts of dust, ash, and debris into the atmosphere\n- Blocked the Sun's radiation, causing global temperatures to drop drastically\n- Disrupted ecosystems and food chains\n\n### The Result\n\nThis extinction event killed all non-avian dinosaurs and most other animals weighing more than 25 kg (55 lb), though some groups like sea turtles and crocodilians survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and the entire Mesozoic Era, giving way to the Cenozoic Era.\n\n**Sources:** Wikipedia articles on \"Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event,\" \"Chicxulub crater,\" and \"Impact winter\"",

This would cause the global temperature to decrease drastically. If an asteroid or comet with the diameter of about 5 km (3.1 mi) or more were to hit in a large deep body of water or explode before hitting the surface, there would still be an enormous amount of debris ejected into the atmosphere. It has been proposed that an impact winter could lead to mass extinction, wiping out many of the world's existing species. The Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event probably involved an impact winter, and led to mass extinction of most tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms (55 pounds)."

Sharing many characteristics with fellow COMECON member states \u2014 the East German economy stood in stark contrast to the market and mixed economies of Western Europe and West Germany. The state established production targets, set prices, and also allocated resources, codifying these decisions in comprehensive plans. The means of production were almost entirely state-owned. The GDR had an above-average standard of living compared to other Eastern Bloc countries or the Soviet Union, and enjoyed favorable duty and tariff terms with the West German market; in 1989, it was estimated that 50 to 60% of its trade was with Western countries. However by the mid-1980s its economy had reached a state of stagnation, contributing to the process of German reunification.\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Germany\nGermany has a highly developed social market economy. It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but has ranked among the world's top four since 1960. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Germany accounted for 23.7% of the Eurozone economy in 2025, with which it has achieved a high degree of economic integration. With a population of around 83,000,000 people, Germany represents the largest consumer market in the European Union. It is a founding member of both the European Union and the Eurozone.\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally, with $1.66 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus of $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Nazi Germany\nLike many other nations at the time, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression, with unemployment soaring after the Wall Street crash of 1929. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they ..."

            "content": "## Economy of East Germany\nThe economy of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany; GDR, DDR) was a command economy following the model of the Soviet Union based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Sharing many characteristics with fellow COMECON member states \u2014 the East German economy stood in stark contrast to the market and mixed economies of Western Europe and West Germany. The state established production targets, set prices, and also allocated resources, codifying these decisions in comprehensive plans. The means of production were almost entirely state-owned. The GDR had an above-average standard of living compared to other Eastern Bloc countries or the Soviet Union, and enjoyed favorable duty and tariff terms with the West German market; in 1989, it was estimated that 50 to 60% of its trade was with Western countries. However by the mid-1980s its economy had reached a state of stagnation, contributing to the process of German reunification.\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Germany\nGermany has a highly developed social market economy. It is the largest national economy in Europe, the third-largest by nominal GDP in the world, and the sixth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Germany's GDP as measured in dollars fluctuates sharply, but has ranked among the world's top four since 1960. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Germany accounted for 23.7% of the Eurozone economy in 2025, with which it has achieved a high degree of economic integration. With a population of around 83,000,000 people, Germany represents the largest consumer market in the European Union. It is a founding member of both the European Union and the Eurozone.\nGermany is the third-largest exporter globally, with $1.66 trillion worth of goods and services exported in 2024. In 2024, Germany recorded a trade surplus of $255 billion, ranking 2nd worldwide. The service sector contributes around 70% of the total GDP, industry 29.1%, and agriculture 0.9%...\n\n---\n\n## Economy of Nazi Germany\nLike many other nations at the time, Germany suffered the economic effects of the Great Depression, with unemployment soaring after the Wall Street crash of 1929. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, he introduced policies aimed at improving the economy. The changes included privatization of state-owned industries, tariffs, and an attempt to achieve autarky (national economic self-sufficiency). Weekly earnings increased by 19% in real terms from 1933 to 1939, but this was largely due to employees working longer hours, while the hourly wage rates remained close to the lowest levels reached during the Great Depression. Reduced foreign trade would mean rationing of consumer goods like poultry, fruit, and clothing for many Germans.\nThe Nazis believed in war as the primary engine of human progress, and argued that the purpose of a country's economy should be to enable that country to fight and win wars of expansion. As such, almost immediately after coming to power, they ..."
