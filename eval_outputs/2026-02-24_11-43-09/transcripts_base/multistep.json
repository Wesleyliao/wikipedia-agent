In this capacity, the vice president is empowered to preside over the United States Senate, but may not vote except to cast a tie-breaking vote. The vice president is elected at the same time as the president to a four-year term of office by the people of the United States through the Electoral College, but the electoral votes are cast separately for these two offices.

It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current.

It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work into metal. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile and can be cut wi..."

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\nIncandescent bulbs are much less ...\n\n---\n\n## Timeline of chemical element discoveries\nThe discoveries of the 118 chemical elements known to exist as of 2026 are presented here in chronological order.

It has a nearly circular orbit around Saturn, but it is also tidally locked, like Saturn's other major moons. It rotates with the same period it revolves or orbitso. Thus, one hemisphere always faces towards the planet. \nThe moon has a fairly low density, composed of roughly three-quarters ice and only one-quarter rock. The surface of Rhea is heavily cratered, with distinct leading and trailing hemispheres. Like the moon Dione, it has high-albedo ice cliffs that appear as bright wispy streaks visible from space. The surface temperature varies between \u2212174 \u00b0C and \u2212220 \u00b0C.\nRhea was discovered in 1672 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Since then, it has been visited by both Voyager probes and was the subject of close targeted flybys by the Cass..."

Titan is the only natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System with an atmosphere that is denser than the atmosphere of Earth and is one of two moons with an atmosphere significant enough to drive weather (the other being the atmosphere of Triton). Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, propane, PAHs and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, acetonitrile, argon and helium. The isotopic study of nitrogen isotopes ratio also suggests acetonitrile may be present in quantities exceeding hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene. The surface pressure is about 50% higher than on Earth at 1.5 bars (147 kPa). This is higher than the pressure at the triple point of m...\n\n---\n\n## Saturn\nSaturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about 9 times that of Earth. It has an eighth of the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third of its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.\nSaturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn's greater size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is about...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere\u2014denser than Earth's\u2014and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km abo..."

In the time since Newton, new insights, especially around the concept of energy, b...\n\n---\n\n## Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica\nPhilosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (English: The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often called simply the Principia (), is a book by Sir Isaac Newton that expounds Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation.\nThe Principia is written in Latin and comprises three volumes, and was authorized (imprimatur) by Samuel Pepys, then-President of the Royal Society on 5 July 1686 and first published in 1687. After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition, Newton published two further editions, during 1713 with errors of the 1687 corrected, and an improved version of 1726.\nThe Principia forms a mathematical foundation for the theory of classical mechanics, and is generally considered to be one of the most important works in the history of science. It has been referred to as \"the greatest scientific work in history\" and \"the supreme expression in human thought of the mind's ability to hold the universe fixed as an object of contemplat...\n\n---\n\n## Principia\nPrincipia may refer to:\n\nPhilosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Isaac Newton's three-volume work about his laws of motion and universal gravitation\nPrincipia (lit. \"primary buildings\"), the headquarters at the center of Roman forts (Latin: castra)\nThe Principia, an educational institution for Christian Scientists in the St. Louis, Missouri, area\nPrincipia College, a private four-year college in Elsah, Illinois\nPrincipia School, a school from early childhood to high school in the St. Louis, Missouri, area\nPrincipia (alga), a stem-group coralline alga\nPrincipia, the former name of Zope, the \"Z Object Publishing Environment\"\n2653 Principia, an asteroid named after Newton's work\nThe Principia (book), by Emanuel Swedenborg\nPrincipia Mathematica, a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead\nPrincipia Ethica, a book on ethics by G.

In recent years the number of skyscrapers in Spain has significantly grown. Of the buildings in this list, just 18 were completed before the year 2000 with all others being completed after that year.\nFor a list of the tallest architectural structures in Spain, which are not classified as buildings, like chimneys, towers and masts, see list of tallest structures in Spain.\n\n---\n\n## List of tallest church buildings\nThis list of tallest church buildings ranks church buildings by height. From the Middle Ages until the advent of the skyscraper, Christian church buildings were often the world's tallest buildings. From 1311, when the spire of Lincoln Cathedral surpassed the height of the Great Pyramid of Giza, until the Washington Monument was completed in 1884, a succession of church buildings held this title.\n\nThe tallest church building in the world is the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in Barcelona, which surpassed Ulm Minster (161.53 m) on 30 October 2025 when its central tower reached 162.91 m. The central tower reached the final height of 172.5 m on 20 February 2026.\nThe tallest completed church building in the world is the Ulm Minster (161.53 m), the main Lutheran congregation in Ulm, Germany.\nThe tallest domed church building, and the tallest Catholic church until surpassed by Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (158 m) in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast.\nThe tallest cathedral as well as the tal...\n\n---\n\n## Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\nBas\u00edlica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, or simply Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, is a church under construction in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world and designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. In 2005, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia was added to an existing (1984) UNESCO World Heritage Site, \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\". On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.\nOn 19 March 1882, construction of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaud\u00ed took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaud\u00ed devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the church's crypt.

Today, inactivated vaccines exist for many pathogens, including influenza, polio (IPV), rabies, hepatitis A, CoronaVac...\n\n---\n\n## Jonas Salk\nJonas Edward Salk (; born Jonas Salk; October 28, 1914 \u2013 June 23, 1995) was an American virologist and medical researcher who developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. He was born in New York City and attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine.\nIn 1947, Salk accepted a professorship at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, where he undertook a project beginning in 1948 to determine the number of different types of poliovirus. For the next seven years, Salk devoted himself to developing a vaccine against polio.\nSalk was immediately hailed as a \"miracle worker\" when the vaccine's success was first made public in April 1955, and chose to not patent the vaccine or seek any profit from it in order to maximize its global distribution. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the University of Pittsburgh looked into patenting the vaccine, but since Salk's techniques were not novel, their patent attorney said, \"If there we...\n\n---\n\n## Polio vaccine\nPolio vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio). Two types are used: an inactivated poliovirus given by injection (IPV) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth (OPV). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio. The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world, and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018.\nThe inactivated polio vaccines are very safe. Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection. Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given. This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection. Both types of vaccine are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS, but are otherwise well. However, the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), a form of the vaccine virus that has reverted to caus..."

Prominently featured in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, screaming women, a dead baby, a dismembered soldier, and flames.\nPicasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a town in the Basque Country in northern Spain, by Nazi Germany's Condor Legion and Fascist Italy. Upon completion, Guernica was exhibited at the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Paris International Exposition and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief. The painting soon became wide..."

It was announced by the Swedish Academy in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 October 2024 and was awarded on 10 December 2024. \nShe is the first South Korean and first Asian woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, making her the 18th woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature and the tenth Asian laureate in that Nobel Prize category.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 2025 Nobel Peace Prize\nThe 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, an international peace prize established according to the will of Alfred Nobel, was announced on 10 October 2025 by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, Norway. It was awarded to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado of Venezuela. The prize was presented at the ceremony on 10 December 2025 in Oslo, given to her daughter on her behalf. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as \"one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times\".\nAt the time of the prize's announcement, Machado was in hiding inside Venezuela, fearing repression from the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. She secretly escaped the country to reach Oslo with the help of international allies, but vowed to return to Venezuela to continue opposing the Maduro regime. Machado said she dedicated her award to Donald Trump and after the 2026 United States intervention in Venezuela she gave him her Nobel medal as a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom, according to...\n\n---\n\n## List of Ig Nobel Prize winners\nA parody of the Nobel Prizes, the Ig Nobel Prizes are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that \"first make people laugh, and then make them think\". Commenting on the 2006 awards, Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable Research and co-sponsor of the awards, said that \"[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology\". All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release."

Teaching began around 1088, with the university becoming organised as universitas scholarium or guilds of students by the late 12th century. The university's emblem carries the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (Latin for 'Nourishing mother of studies') and the date A.D. 1088. With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe.\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university (Bettisia Gozzadini), and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor (Laura Bassi). The University of Bologna had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, when..."

Many academics consider the University of Al-Qarawiyyin\\'s transformation into a modern university to have occurred in 1963 when it was reorganized and formally recognized as a university in Morocco\\'s modern state university system.\\n\\nThe University of Bologna is considered the oldest because it meets the academic historians\\' definition of a \"university\" - with the distinctive structural and legal features that developed in medieval Europe - and has maintained continuous institutional operation since its founding.\\n\\n**Sources:** University of Bologna Wikipedia article and University of al-Qarawiyyin Wikipedia article.', type='text')"

It is the most recognizable feature on Jupiter, known for its distinctive red-orange color (whose origin is still unknown). Located about 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind speeds of up to 432 km/h (268 mph).\n\n## How Long Has It Been Observed?\n\nThe observational history of the Great Red Spot is:\n- **First recorded observation**: September 1831\n- **Documented observations**: 60 recorded observations between 1831 and 1878, when continuous observations began\n- **Historical note**: A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713. If this were the same storm, it would have existed for at least 361 years. However, a 2024 study suggests that the 1665-1713 spot was likely not the same storm as the current one.\n\nSo while the Great Red Spot that is currently observable has been continuously documented since **1831** (approximately 193 years), it may have existed for even longer if observations were continuous during that entire period. The storm is remarkable for its longevity compared to other weather systems.",

However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot.
