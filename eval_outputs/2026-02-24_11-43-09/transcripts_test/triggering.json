The ride featured a turbulent journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics. Originally named Countdown to Extinction when the park opened on April 22, 1998, the ride was re-named to Dinosaur in 2000 to promote Disney Animation's feature film of the same name. In the attraction, the two prominently featured dinosaurs were the Iguanodon and Carnotaurus, which were also featured in the film. Scenes from the movie also appeared in the pre-show.\nIn August 2024, it was announced at the D23 fan event that the area that the ride is located in, DinoLand U.S.A., will be replaced with a new land called Tropical Americas, which is expected to open in Fall 2027, with an Indiana Jones attraction replacing Dinosaur.

On land, all archosauromorph reptiles other than crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs became extinct.

Its center is offshore, but the crater is named after the onshore community of Chicxulub Pueblo (not to be confused with the larger coastal town of Chicxulub Puerto). It was formed slightly over 66 million years ago when an asteroid, about ten kilometers (six miles) in diameter, struck Earth.

The event caused the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs and most other tetrapods weighing more than 25 kg (55 lb), with the exception of some ectothermic species such as sea turtles and crocodilians. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period, and with it the Mesozoic era, while heralding the beginning of the current geological era, the Cenozoic Era. In the geologic record, the K\u2013Pg event is marked by a thin layer of sediment called the K\u2013Pg boundary or K\u2013T boundary, which can be found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks.

If an asteroid were to strike land or a shallow body of water, it would eject an enormous amount of dust, ash, and other material into the atmosphere, blocking the radiation from the Sun. This would cause the global temperature to decrease drastically. If an asteroid or comet with the diameter of about 5 km (3.1 mi) or more were to hit in a large deep body of water or explode before hitting the surface, there would still be an enormous amount of debris ejected into the atmosphere. It has been proposed that an impact winter could lead to mass extinction, wiping out many of the world's existing species. The Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event probably involved an impact winter, and led to mass extinction of most tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms (55 pounds)."

The ride featured a turbulent journey through the late Cretaceous period, featuring prehistoric scenes populated with dinosaur audio-animatronics. Originally named Countdown to Extinction when the park opened on April 22, 1998, the ride was re-named to Dinosaur in 2000 to promote Disney Animation's feature film of the same name. In the attraction, the two prominently featured dinosaurs were the Iguanodon and Carnotaurus, which were also featured in the film. Scenes from the movie also appeared in the pre-show.\nIn August 2024, it was announced at the D23 fan event that the area that the ride is located in, DinoLand U.S.A., will be replaced with a new land called Tropical Americas, which is expected to open in Fall 2027, with an Indiana Jones attraction replacing Dinosaur. Dinosaur closed on February 2, 2026.\n\n---\n\n## Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction\nThe Triassic\u2013Jurassic (Tr-J) extinction event, often called the Triassic\u2013Jurassic mass extinction (TJME) or end-Triassic extinction, marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 201.4 million years ago. It represents one of five major extinction events during the Phanerozoic, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. \nIn the seas, about 23\u201334% of marine genera disappeared; corals, bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, and radiolarians suffered severe losses of diversity and conodonts were completely wiped out, while marine vertebrates, gastropods, and benthic foraminifera were relatively unaffected. On land, all archosauromorph reptiles other than crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs became extinct. Crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and mammals were left largely untouched, allowing them to become the dominant land animals for the next 135 million years. Plants were likewise significantly affected by the crisis, with floral communities undergoing radi..."
