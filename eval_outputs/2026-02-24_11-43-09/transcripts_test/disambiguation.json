Oak eventually evolved to become Java.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\nJava was designed with the principle of \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA), enabling compiled Java code to run on all platforms that support Java without needing recompilation. Java applications are compiled to bytecode that runs on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent.\n\n**Language Design:**\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language with syntax similar to C and C++, but with fewer low-level facilities. It provides dynamic capabilities such as reflection and runtime code modification.\n\n**Popularity:**\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release and has remained widely used. As of 2022, Java was the third most popular programming language according to GitHub, though it has experienced a gradual decline in recent years as other JVM-based languages have emerged.\n\n**Sources:** Wikipedia articles on \"Java (programming language)\", \"Oak (programming language)\", and \"Sun Microsystems\"",

Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalk\u00fcl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado B\u00f6hm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.\n\n---\n\n## Java (programming language)\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaini...\n\n---\n\n## Outline of the Java programming language\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Java:\nJava is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented, class-based, strong, and statically typed programming language that is compiled to Java bytecode for execution on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), where you can write once and run anywhere. Java was designed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and was a core component of Sun's Java platform."

            "content": "## History of programming languages\nThe history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax. Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory led to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.\nThe first high-level programming language was Plankalk\u00fcl, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado B\u00f6hm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.\n\n---\n\n## Java (programming language)\nJava is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.\nJava gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a popular programming language since then. Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub. Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaini...\n\n---\n\n## Outline of the Java programming language\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Java:\nJava is a general-purpose, concurrent, object-oriented, class-based, strong, and statically typed programming language that is compiled to Java bytecode for execution on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), where you can write once and run anywhere. Java was designed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s and was a core component of Sun's Java platform."
