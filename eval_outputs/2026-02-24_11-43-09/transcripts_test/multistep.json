The tantalum\u2013tungsten alloys are characterized by their high melting points and tension resistance. The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.  Some common variants are:\n\n(Ta \u2013 2.5% W): also called tantaloy 63 metal. The percentage of tungsten is about 2\u20133% and includes 0.5% of niobium.

An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten.

It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current.

Four are considered stable (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and one is slightly radioactive, 180W, with an extremely long half-life of (1.59\u00b10.05)\u00d71018 years. This results in about two alpha decays of 180W per gram of natural tungsten per year, so for most practical purposes, 180W can be considered stable. The other naturally occurring isotopes are also capable of alpha decay and so only observationally stable.\nArtificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been observed from 156W to 197W, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 120.96 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.77 days and 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days.

The properties of the final alloy are a combination of properties from the two elements: tungsten,  the element with the highest melting point, and tantalum, which has high corrosion resistance.\nTantalum\u2013tungsten alloys typically vary in their percentage of tungsten.  Some common variants are:\n\n(Ta \u2013 2.5% W): also called tantaloy 63 metal. The percentage of tungsten is about 2\u20133% and includes 0.5% of niobium.  This alloy has a good resistance to corrosion and performs well at high temperatures. An example application is piping in chemical industries.\n(Ta \u2013 7.5% W): also called tantaloy 61 metal, has 7\u20138% tungsten. The difference from this alloy to the others is that this alloy represents a high resilience modulus while maintaining its refractory pro...\n\n---\n\n## Tungsten\nTungsten (also called wolfram) is a chemical element which has the symbol W (from German: Wolfram) and atomic number 74. It is a metal found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in compounds with other elements. It was identified as a distinct element in 1781 and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include scheelite and wolframite, the latter lending the element its alternative name.\nThe free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all known elements, at 3,422 \u00b0C (6,192 \u00b0F; 3,695 K). It also has the highest boiling point, at 5,930 \u00b0C (10,706 \u00b0F; 6,203 K). Its density is 19.254 g/cm3, comparable with that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead.

The filament is enclosed in a glass bulb that is either evacuated or filled with inert gas to protect the filament from oxidation. Electric current is supplied to the filament by terminals or wires embedded in the glass. A bulb socket provides mechanical support and electrical connections.\nIncandescent bulbs are manufactured in a wide range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the incandescent bulb became widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.\nIncandescent bulbs are much less ...\n\n---\n\n## Isotopes of tungsten\nNaturally occurring tungsten (74W) consists of five isotopes. Four are considered stable (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and one is slightly radioactive, 180W, with an extremely long half-life of (1.59\u00b10.05)\u00d71018 years. This results in about two alpha decays of 180W per gram of natural tungsten per year, so for most practical purposes, 180W can be considered stable. The other naturally occurring isotopes are also capable of alpha decay and so only observationally stable.\nArtificial radioisotopes of tungsten have been observed from 156W to 197W, the most stable of which are 181W with a half-life of 120.96 days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1 days, 188W with a half-life of 69.77 days and 178W with a half-life of 21.6 days. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than one day, and most of these less than 8 minutes. The most stable known meta state is 179m1W with half-life 6.40 minutes.\n\n---\n\n## Tungsten\nTungsten (also called wolfram) is a chemical element which has the symbol W (from German: Wolfram) and atomic number 74.

Named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.\nA relatively low-density body composed mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its dark leading hemisphere and its bright trailing hemisphere, as well as a massive equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Saturn\nSaturn has 274 confirmed moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Saturn's moons are diverse in size, ranging from tiny moonlets to Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and the second largest moon in the Solar System. Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit).

Titan is far colder than Earth, but of all the places in the Solar System, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface. Its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are small and large bodies of both liquid methane and ethane, and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell. Some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide prebiotic chemistry for living cells different from those on Earth.\nIn June 2010, scientists analyzing data from the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.

With an estimated diameter of 1,469 km (913 mi), it is the third-largest moon of Saturn and the eleventh-largest in the Solar System. Named after the Titan Iapetus from Greek mythology, the moon was discovered in 1671 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini.\nA relatively low-density body composed mostly of ice, Iapetus is home to several distinctive and unusual features, such as a striking difference in coloration between its dark leading hemisphere and its bright trailing hemisphere, as well as a massive equatorial ridge that runs three-quarters of the way around the moon.\n\n---\n\n## Moons of Saturn\nSaturn has 274 confirmed moons, the most of any planet in the Solar System. Saturn's moons are diverse in size, ranging from tiny moonlets to Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury and the second largest moon in the Solar System. Three of these moons possess particularly notable features: Titan has a nitrogen-rich, Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes, Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow, and Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains which are among the tallest in the Solar System.\nTwenty-four of the confirmed moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane (except Iapetus, which has a prograde but significantly inclined orbit). They include the seven rounded satellites, and four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with some of the large moons. Fou...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere\u2014denser than Earth's\u2014and is the only known object in the Solar System besides Earth with clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid. Titan is one of seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 48.16% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan is mostly ice, which is less dense.\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii or 1,200,000 km abo..."

            "content": "## Atmosphere of Titan\nThe atmosphere of Titan is the dense layer of gases surrounding Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Titan is the only natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System with an atmosphere that is denser than the atmosphere of Earth and is one of two moons with an atmosphere significant enough to drive weather (the other being the atmosphere of Triton). Titan's lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen (94.2%), methane (5.65%), and hydrogen (0.099%). There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene, propane, PAHs and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, acetonitrile, argon and helium. The isotopic study of nitrogen isotopes ratio also suggests acetonitrile may be present in quantities exceeding hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene. The surface pressure is about 50% higher than on Earth at 1.5 bars (147 kPa). This is higher than the pressure at the triple point of m...\n\n---\n\n## Life on Titan\nWhether there is life on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is currently an open question and a topic of scientific assessment and research. Titan is far colder than Earth, but of all the places in the Solar System, Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have liquids in the form of rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface. Its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are small and large bodies of both liquid methane and ethane, and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell. Some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide prebiotic chemistry for living cells different from those on Earth.\nIn June 2010, scientists analyzing data from the Cassini\u2013Huygens mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes. The Cassini\u2013Huygens miss...\n\n---\n\n## Titan (moon)\nTitan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System.

Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.\nMany other inventions marked Bell's later life, including ground-breaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society a...\n\n---\n\n## History of the telephone\nThis history of the telephone chronicles the development of the electrical telephone, and includes a brief overview of its predecessors.  The first telephone patent was granted to Alexander Graham Bell in 1876.\n\n---\n\n## Invention of the telephone\nThe invention of the telephone was the culmination of work done by many different people, and led to an array of lawsuits relating to the conflicting patent claims made by several individuals and numerous companies. Notable people included in this process were Antonio Meucci, Philipp Reis, Elisha Gray and Alexander Graham Bell.\n\n"

The largest animals on the planet are not the only ones to have large body parts, with some smaller animals actually having one particularly enlarged area of the body.\nFurthermore, there are two kinds of body parts described in this article. Absolute largest, and largest in relation to its body size. This distinction is critical in evolutionary biology, as traits like the extremely long tail feathers of the ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), which are the longest in relation to body size of any bird, are often the result of intense sexual selection.\n\n---\n\n## Sternum\nThe sternum (pl.: sternums or sterna) or breastbone is a long flat bone located in the central part of the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The word sternum originates from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (st\u00e9rnon) 'chest'."

Bones undergo continuous remodeling: osteoclasts resorb old bone, and osteoblasts synthesize new bone. With advancing age, the rate of resorption exceeds that of bone formation, causing bones to lose density and become more susceptible to fractures.\nIt is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. Bones that commonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bones of the forearm, the wrist, and the hip.\nUntil a broken bone occurs, there are typically no symptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree that a break may occur with minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, some people may have chronic pain and a decreased ability to carry out normal activities.\nOsteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bo..."

The animal begins at rest with its torso upright and elbows fixed, with both hands clinging to a vertical support, such as the side of a tree or bamboo stalk.  To move from one support to another, it pushes off from one vertical support with its hindlimbs, landing on another vertical support after an extended period of free flight. Vertical clinging and leaping primates have evolved a specialized anatomy to compensate for the physical implications of this form of locomotion. These key morphological specializations have been identified in prosimian fossils from as early as the Eocene."

There are several types of skeletons, including the exoskeleton, which is a rigid outer shell that holds up an organism's shape; the endoskeleton, a rigid internal frame to which the organs and soft tissues attach; and the hydroskeleton, a flexible internal structure supported by the hydrostatic pressure of body fluids.\nVertebrates are animals with an endoskeleton centered around an axial vertebral column, and their skeletons are typically composed of bones and cartilages. Invertebrates are other animals that lack a vertebral column, and their skeletons vary, including hard-shelled exoskeleton (arthropods and most molluscs), plated internal shells (e.g. cuttlebones in some cephalopods) or rods (e.g. ossicles in echinoderms), hydrostatically supported body cavities (most), and spicules (sponges).

Significant adverse effects of long-term weightlessness include muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton (spaceflight osteopenia). Other significant effects include a slowing of cardiovascular system functions, decreased production of red blood cells (space anemia), balance disorders, eyesight disorders and changes in the immune system. Additional symptoms include fluid redistribution (causing the \"moon-face\" appearance typical in pictures of astronauts experiencing weightlessness), loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and excess flatulence.

The largest animals on the planet are not the only ones to have large body parts, with some smaller animals actually having one particularly enlarged area of the body.\nFurthermore, there are two kinds of body parts described in this article. Absolute largest, and largest in relation to its body size. This distinction is critical in evolutionary biology, as traits like the extremely long tail feathers of the ribbon-tailed astrapia (Astrapia mayeri), which are the longest in relation to body size of any bird, are often the result of intense sexual selection.\n\n---\n\n## Sternum\nThe sternum (pl.: sternums or sterna) or breastbone is a long flat bone located in the central part of the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The word sternum originates from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (st\u00e9rnon) 'chest'."

It was first described by American paleontologist Elmer S. Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for \"arm lizard\", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means \"deep chest\". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons (31.2 to 51.7 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods.

Teaching began around 1088, with the university becoming organised as universitas scholarium or guilds of students by the late 12th century. The university's emblem carries the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (Latin for 'Nourishing mother of studies') and the date A.D. 1088. With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe.\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university (Bettisia Gozzadini), and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor (Laura Bassi).

Together with the University of Bologna, Padua had a central role in the Italian Renaissance, housing and educating a number of Italian Renaissance mathematicians, amongst them Nicolaus Copernicus. It is also known for its long-standing tradition in medicine and anatomy, linked to great figures such as Andreas Vesalius, the \"father of modern anatomy,\" and Galileo Galilei, who once taught there.

The list includes airlines founded before December 31, 1930.\nRows with a light-green background indicate the earliest predecessor company of an airline that is still operating, either as a parent company or a subsidiary company (many modern airline holding companies operate more than one airline). Of the airlines still operating, Air France has the oldest predecessor company, Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale transa\u00e9rienne, which was established in 1909 and began scheduled fixed-wing passenger operations in 1913. Another Air France predecessor, Lignes A\u00e9riennes Farman, began the first regular international passenger service in 1919. KLM is the oldest airline still operating under its original name, Koninklijke Luchtvaartmaatschappij, under which it was established in 1919 and began operating the following year.  \nThe date of the first airline service may differ from the foundation date of the company. \n\nFor airlines founded after 1930 see ...\n\n---\n\n## List of oldest universities in continuous operation\nThis is a list of the oldest existing universities in continuous operation in the world.\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time. This definition limits the term \"university\" to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities.\nTo be included in the list, the university must have been founded prior to 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also still be in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history.

It is the oldest university in continuous operation in the world, and the first degree-awarding institution of higher learning. Teaching began around 1088, with the university becoming organised as universitas scholarium or guilds of students by the late 12th century. The university's emblem carries the motto Alma Mater Studiorum (Latin for 'Nourishing mother of studies') and the date A.D. 1088. With over 90,000 students, the University of Bologna is one of the largest universities in Europe.\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university (Bettisia Gozzadini), and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor (Laura Bassi). The University of Bologna had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, when...\n\n---\n\n## University of Padua\nThe University of Padua (Italian: Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, UNIPD) is an Italian public research university in Padua, Italy. It was founded in 1222 by a group of students and teachers from the University of Bologna, who previously settled in Vicenza; thus, it is the second-oldest university in Italy, as well as the world's fifth-oldest surviving university.\nThe University of Padua was one of the most prominent universities in early modern Europe, known particularly for the rigor of its Aristotelian logic and science. Together with the University of Bologna, Padua had a central role in the Italian Renaissance, housing and educating a number of Italian Renaissance mathematicians, amongst them Nicolaus Copernicus. It is also known for its long-standing tradition in medicine and anatomy, linked to great figures such as Andreas Vesalius, the \"father of modern anatomy,\" and Galileo Galilei, who once taught there. The university also proudly houses the world's oldest anatomical theatr..."

However, their interiors are relatively cloud-free, and unlike Jupiter's spot, which has lasted for hundreds of years, their lifetimes appear to be shorter, forming and dissipating once every few years or so. Based on observations taken with Voyager 2 and since then with the Hubble Space Telescope, Neptune appears to spend somewhat more than half its time with a Great Dark Spot.

Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). It was first observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began. A similar spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; if this is the same storm, it has existed for at least 361 years, but a study from 2024 suggests this is not the case."
